life is an illusion , at least on a quantum level , in a theory which has recently been confirmed by a set of researchers . they finally have the means to test john wheeler s delayed - choice theory and concluded that the physicist was right . in 1978 , mr wheeler s proposed experiment involved a moving object that was given the choice to act like a wave or a particle the former acting as a vibration with a frequency that can distinguish it from other waves and the latter having no frequency that you can determine its position in space , unlike a wave and at what point does it decide to act like one or the other . at the time , the technology was not available to conduct a strong experiment , but scientists have now been able to carry it out .
unfortunately , he hasn t yet attacked her for islamic terrorism - connections , but we know he will . below are several links that explain in detail why having huma abedin anywhere near the white house would be like inviting in the terrorism - linked muslim brotherhood , which has been banned in egypt and the uae . bNi readers , please forward the damning [ ]
the los angeles police department has been denied 3 million in federal aid for law enforcement . while there is no official announcement as to why , it is more than likely that it has everything to do with la s sanctuary city status for harboring illegal aliens . donald trump and attorney general jeff sessions have repeatedly said [ ]
the white house has decided to quietly withdraw from all its ties with the ramallah - based palestinian authority and mahmoud abbas . debka ( h / t marvin w ) deBKafile s exclusive sources report that the trump administration has resolved to scrap all ties with the palestinian leadership in retaliation for its campaign against us president donald trump and his jerusalem policy . several warnings to mahmoud abbas ( aka abu mazen ) of what was in store if he did not desist from castigating the us president fell on death ears . last week , two arab crown princes , saudi muhammed bin salman and Uae sheikh muhammed bin zayed , summoned abbas to their capitals and urged him strongly to back away from his attacks on president trump . he got the same advice from the ruler of qatar , sheikh tamim al thani , who conferred with washington on the subject all to no avail . the trump administration has therefore set out an eight - point program of sanctions , first revealed here : the israeli - palestinian peace plan under preparation in washington will not be submitted to ramallah only to israel and the relevant arab governments . us - palestinian interaction is to be suspended not just at the senior levels but in day - to - day interchanges . the administration has notified palestinian and other arab parties to stop addressing queries on political and economic matters to the us consulate in jerusalem , because they will not receive answers . the status of the plo office in washington will be reevaluated with a view to shutting it down . palestinian officials will no longer be invited to washington by the us government , including the state department and department of treasury . above all , they will not be welcome at the white house or the national security council where us middle east policy is designed . senior us officials congratulated the senior palestinian negotiator saab erekat , who also holds the pa s american portfolio , on his recovery from illness , at the same time warning him that he would no longer be received at the white house . the trump administration will not make any public announcement of the cutoff of financial aid to the palestinians . since the funds are mostly earmarked for specific economic projects , each allocation will simply be held back on the pretext of the need for a reappraisal . the us will halt its contributions to the Un work and relief organization , an estimated one billion dollars per annum . the us administration moreover intervened with the governments of saudi arabia , abu dhabi and qatar with a request that they freeze or slow their economic aid to the palestinian authority . according deBKafile s sources , palestinian officials in ramallah were devastated by news of the sudden cutoff of the main sources of the pa s revenue . even the qatar ruler , whom abbas visited last week as a last resort to save the pa from economic meltdown , refused to release any more funding .
the time has come to cut off the tongues of those who support peace and those who mourn it . ( can t disagree there , arab muslims occupying israel will never live in peace with the native population the jews ) .
the central american nation and six other states voted with the us and israel , in contrast to the rest of the un general assembly which last week voted 128 - 9 to condemn the us decision to recognize jerusalem . hotovely did not name any of the 10 countries , but said many had a strong christian tradition . philippines , the czech republic and romania abstained from the unga vote last week , but have entertained the possibility of joining guatemala and the united states , with czech president milos zeman supporting the move to jerusalem . i spoke yesterday with my friend the guatemalan president , and thanked him for his support of us through his vote in the un , he said in the knesset . i expressed my hope that he will follow president trump s footsteps and recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , and will begin the process of moving the embassy there . that night he released an announcement that he would in fact do so . so i want to say , from here , to the president of guatemala : may god bless you , my friend , and may god bless our countries .
un - backed police massacred haitians with impunity when the police finally left the campus , around 11 a . m . , nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard five of whom had been shot in the head . at 5 o ' clock on the morning of november 13 , more than 200 haitian police officers raided the grand ravine area of port - au - prince . there was a series of loud explosions , followed by gunfire . for the next six hours , the commotion didn t stop . the neighborhood was under siege . what had started as an anti - gang operation in a poor and largely forgotten neighborhood in a poor and largely forgotten country ended in the summary execution of innocent civilians on a school campus . the police officers were working with the united nations mission for justice support in haiti . it was launched in october , a reboot of a previous mission that had begun in 2004 , when thousands of u . n . troops were sent to haiti following a coup d etat , tasked in part with restoring stability and reinforcing national police capacities . and though the u . n . mission issued a statement days after the raid calling for a prompt investigation by haitian authorities , it did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation . but in late december , a u . n . spokesperson confirmed to the intercept for the first time that the mission had helped plan the raid , though it distanced itself from the civilian deaths . the reported civilian death [ s ] were not part of the planned operation but of a unilateral action conducted by some [ haitian police ] officers after the conclusion of the operation , the spokesperson , sophie boutaud de la combe , wrote in an email . the raid of the school , according to the u . n . statement , was done without authorization , without alerting the police hierarchy , and outside of the operational plan . the u . n . mission did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation . boutaud de la combe said that , a day after the raid , the u . n . conducted an internal enquiry with all the unit commanders who participated in the operation . the u . n . inquiry , not previously reported , absolved the u . n . finding that u . n . police did not fire their weapons and only secured the perimeter of the school , she said . none of the [ u . n . police ] unit proceeded to the location at maranatha college where the alleged killings took place , the spokesperson wrote . the planned portion of the operation went relatively well . the post - operation unilateral initiative of some hnp members to conduct a high risk search , proceeding outside of the operational cadre , without advising the hierarchy , without authorization and contravening the operation plan was not part of the planned operation . when i arrived at the maranatha evangelical college campus , traveling with a broadcast team from al jazeera four days after the raid , it was immediately obvious something heinous had transpired . the blood that stained the concrete was still wet , unable to dry in the blanket of fog and mist that kept the capital unusually cool that particular week . water pooled in the courtyard s clogged drain had turned a dark red , partially obscuring an empty tear gas canister . the smell of the violence still hung in the heavy air . classrooms and offices had been ransacked , the contents of closets , drawers , and bookcases spilled across the floors and through the doorways . light crept in through holes left by bullets that had pierced through the thick concrete . sometime since the raid , someone had swept another five empty tear gas canisters and close to 100 heavy artillery shells into a pile . water pooled in the courtyard s clogged drain had turned a dark red . the morning we arrived , faculty and students were meeting to mourn those who had been killed . the school was still closed . they gathered in one of the small classrooms , closed the door to us outsiders , and began to sing . the religious hymns deep , soulful melodies echoed throughout the courtyard where they mixed with cries of grieving victims and family members anxious to tell their stories . i must kill myself , monique larosse , whose nephew was shot in this courtyard days earlier , told us . why did they kill him when they know he was not one of the bad men he was someone who went to church , studied , and had principles . the stories larose , along with other survivors and family members , told me make clear something went horribly wrong on that mid - november day . while there s a lot still unclear , one thing is for certain the official narrative is at odds with what the people of grand ravine say they witnessed and experienced . and they are a far ways off from finding justice . located near the southern entrance to haiti s sprawling capital , grand ravine is built on a hillside with picturesque views of the caribbean sea . and yet , it s a downtrodden neighborhood . haphazard construction with paltry regulation has left neighborhoods , including grand ravine , with little to no infrastructure or government services . many areas are only accessible by foot . narrow , misshapen alleys ascend through the concrete homes secured with rusted sheet metal . amid all this is the maranatha evangelical college , which has operated here since the 1940 s . despite the name , it offers classes for neighborhood kids beginning in preschool . the campus is a mashup of school buildings , houses and a healthy number of full - size trees , a dissonant image in a city overwhelmed by concrete . a low wall marks it off from the surrounding area . the only entrance to the elevated campus is a sloping , winding road that sits behind a large metal gate . the campus is a refuge , an oasis of calm in a section of haiti rife with gang activity . grand ravine is a red zone , the label international forces give to the country s most violence - prone areas . in december 2016 , grand ravine s most powerful gang leader , junior decimus , was arrested at the airport when he attempted to travel abroad . soon after , according to a report by local rights organization justice and peace , an armed conflict began as others sought to consolidate control of the neighborhood . bursts of automatic weapons sang during the day , while police officers from the nearby station watched helplessly , according to a hard copy of the organization s report . in october , the month before the police raid , groups of armed youth set up roadblocks , robbing cars in plain sight as they passed . the official narrative is at odds with what the people of grand ravine say they witnessed and experienced . the same month , thousands of u . n . soldiers stationed in the country since the 2004 coup d etat withdrew . brought to haiti to restore stability , the foreign troops have been involved in multiple deadly raids into neighborhoods similar to grand ravine . the international community has spent hundreds of millions training the haitian police for the u . n . s eventual departure . the u . n . stabilization mission in haiti ended its mandate in october , but the u . n . is by no means gone . in place of troops , the u . n . created a smaller successor mission composed of a few thousand police officers . in early november , together with the local police force responsible for the capital , that new u . n . mission helped plan the anti - gang raid into grand ravine . the november 13 raid was one of the first major acts involving the new mission , and the response will define the future of the u . n . s relationship with the people of grand ravine and the success of the newly empowered local police force . at 6 : 30 on that mid - november morning , armand louis received a phone call from maranatha college , the school he has directed for the last 30 years . something was wrong . the police raid had spilled onto the school s campus . when he arrived nearly two hours later , tear gas was already being employed by police , according to an investigation by the national network of human rights defenders , a local human rights organization known by its french acronym , rnddh , and confirmed in an interview with louis . the following account is based on intercept interviews with multiple witnesses , whose recollections mirror those included in rnddh s subsequent report on the massacre . police opened and searched classrooms , ransacking them in an apparent attempt to locate gang members hiding on campus . they didn t find any . there was a brief period of calm . people still on campus gave water to police . the burning in their eyes from the tear gas subsided . an hour later , louis said , the school s guard , julio fongene , approached him and said that a number of gang members had threatened him and were hiding in a storage facility on campus . louis informed the police . the campus is a refuge , an oasis of calm in a section of haiti rife with gang activity . when officers attempted to dislodge the hiding gang members , two police officers were shot . the gang members fled . it does not appear that any were apprehended , as the police have not made public any arrests of those responsible for shooting the officers . u . n . units composed of police from jordan and senegal responded to reports of shots fired and arrived at the school . according to the u . n . , they administered first aid to the injured police officers and secured the perimeter . but on campus grounds , haitian police proceeded to punish the bystanders caught up in the violence . first , they shot and killed fongene , the guard , witnesses said . police then accused louis of setting them up . they dragged him into the central courtyard , where some faculty members and people who live on campus were present . the officers beat him with a chair , causing significant injuries to his head and torso . the protestant evangelical baptist mission of haiti , affiliated with the school , included an account of the beating in its statement describing the events , and it was confirmed in an interview with louis and in the rnddh report . faculty tried to intervene . david jean baptiste , a professor , was beaten and then shot five times , including a bullet to the head . the courtyard grounds where he died remained bloodstained for days after . vanel danger lives on the school s campus and is responsible for the cafeteria . he told the intercept that an officer put a gun to his head and threatened to pull out his teeth if he didn t cooperate . danger dropped to his knees and begged for his life . danger told the officer he had given him water just an hour earlier , rnddh reported . danger was spared . but many more weren t so lucky . louis , bloody and beaten , told the intercept he was handcuffed by an officer in a u . n . uniform and hauled off to jail . when the police finally left the campus , around 11 a . m . , nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard five of whom had been shot in the head . not a single firearm was recovered , suggesting that the killings were summary executions , rnddh reported . the bodies were not removed until the next afternoon . four days after the raid , the alleys that weave around the campus and through the neighborhood s hilly landscape were largely deserted . groups of young kids watched us from rooftops . darting eyes peering from behind small openings in concrete homes followed us throughout the neighborhood . very few of them wanted to speak . there are many more victims of this and other shootings , a local resident and student at the school explained . they are afraid , added the student , whose name the intercept is withholding out of concern for their safety . though the anti - gang raid ended with a schoolyard massacre , questions linger about what happened outside the campus , where the raid began . at first , the police acknowledged seven civilian deaths all of which occurred at the school . overall , the police made 32 arrests , but haven t acknowledged any deaths outside of the school . but in its investigation , rnddh concluded that one of the people found dead on campus had been pulled out of his house in the surrounding neighborhood that morning and brought to the school only after his death . the total death toll remains unknown . haitian police punished the bystanders caught up in the violence . doresne jean , director of the saint claire morgue in downtown port - au - prince , said that eight bodies had arrived from grand ravine on tuesday , the day after the raid more than the police originally acknowledged . but jean said there were surely more . maybe the police moved some bodies , jean said , because we had five or six people come here to ask if we had their relatives . they were not on the list of bodies already received . justice and peace , the local human rights organization that has been monitoring violence in neighborhoods such as grand ravine , was one of the first to investigate the massacre . rovelsond apollon , an observer there , said his organization had confirmed 12 dead , but that the real total would likely never be known . not that many people , even in haiti , are paying attention to what happens in grand ravine . a hundred or even 200 could die there and nobody would know , apollon said . i don ' t know how i am going to live without my son , gina napolean told us from the school s courtyard , the grief visible on her face just four days after the massacre . her only son , 22 - year - old kens napoleon , had been the family s breadwinner . he was killed by a shot to the head . she put the blame squarely on the government , who she accused of sending the police to kill our children . it s not just that politicians exert control over the police , apollon said they are involved with the gangs themselves . his organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire , he explained , and they said the weapons had been provided by politicians . politicians and authorities are not innocent in what happened , because they , too , play their part in the violence , he said . the politicians , for their part , have not publicly addressed these accusations . but since the raid , nearly every government official or institution has avoided taking responsibility . asked about the raid , the police chief simply said it was planned by the local captain and the new u . n . mission . prime minister jack guy lafontant told the press that the specifics of field operations were outside his purview . both blamed poor planning for the bloodshed . the operation was compromised from the beginning . police officers told local human rights investigators that confidential information about the operation was circulating even before it took place . a former haitian military official later told me that he found out about the raid when he heard it being discussed on an open radio channel on november 12 , the day before it was launched . a gang leader later called in to a local radio show , alleging that a rival gang from a different neighborhood had participated with police in the raid itself . others have suggested the raid was an attempt to recover a cache of guns that authorities had distributed in the neighborhood weeks earlier . and so the rumor mill in haiti churns . the u . n . s statement that its officers were stationed only at the perimeter of the school contradicts the statements made by louis , who told me he was handcuffed by a u . n . agent on campus . the u . n . insists that it was uninvolved because its officers were not in the courtyard , but the entrance where they say they were stationed is set just below the scene of the massacre . the new u . n . mission is ostensibly focused on justice , but apollon noted that haiti has seen many international missions throughout its history . they all failed , he said , because they do not understand the haitian reality . in haiti , he said , impunity reigns . david jean baptiste , a professor , was beaten and then shot five times , including a bullet to the head . nearly two months after the massacre , no one has been publicly held responsible . the police inspector general has completed an investigation and passed it on to a judge , who could order the arrest or dismissal of officers involved . one police officer accused of involvement is already missing , according to the inspector general . families of nine victims , including those of the two police officers , received a one - time payment of about 1 , 500 for funeral expenses . but none of the intellectual authors of the botched raid appear to have been identified or questioned . instead , it was louis , the school s director , who was arrested for complicity in the death of the two police officers . after being publicly beaten with a chair at the school he had overseen for 30 years , louis was held in a port - au - prince jail for more than a week . under pressure from religious organizations and the school s faculty , louis was eventually released for health reasons . but he still has not returned to the school . in a country like mine , louis wrote to me weeks later , it is hard to take our leaders at their word . that , he continued , was why we need to know what the real motive [ of the raid ] was . the public authorities have not yet interviewed him . do they really want everything to be investigated properly he said , or was this all planned apollon said continued raids would do little to address the fundamental problems afflicting neighborhoods such as grand ravine . rather , violence stems from the total absence of the state in such areas , and it will continue so long as the population s needs are not met . what residents need , he said , is education . after the raid , the school was closed for two weeks . we need school , a student at maranatha told me that day in the courtyard . without education , what hope do we have this article previously appeared in the intercept .
it should have come as no surprise that the same rebels the us supported in its 2011 war against libya are now selling blacks into slavery at auction , said robin philpot , who pub
when the police finally left the campus , around 11 a . m . , nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard five of whom had been shot in the head .
zambia must clarify whether it will host israel - africa summit israel since 1948 has collaborated with the same white supremacist forces which conquered , exploited and oppressed african people and their descendants throughout the world . several news articles were published in early december indicating that zambian president edgar lungu has agreed to host a summit meeting between african union ( au ) member - states and the state of israel . ( see jerusalem post , dec . 3 , 2017 ) these reports first surfaced during the inauguration ceremony for kenyan president uhuru kenyatta in nairobi . president lungu attended the second induction into office of kenyatta who is the leader of east africa s largest economy . lungu met with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on the sidelines of the kenyatta inauguration events . the zambian leader was photographed shaking hands with netanyahu during the meeting . a similar summit was scheduled earlier in 2017 in the west african state of togo . however , mass demonstrations by togolese opposition parties and coalitions demanding the resignation of the government of president faure gnassingbe for undemocratic practices , forced lome to postpone the announced summit . the zambian leader was photographed shaking hands with netanyahu during the meeting . zambia s largest newspaper the times reported on december 5 that : president edgar lungu , who met israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu last week at the re - inauguration ceremonies for kenyan president uhuru kenyatta in nairobi , told znbc that for whatever reason , we have been given the mandate to host this summit which will bring its own benefits to zambia . president lungu said prime minister netanyahu had asked zambia to host an africa - israel summit that was originally scheduled for togo in september . despite this claim of mystification by president lungu , it is quite obvious that there were definite reasons why zambia was targeted to host the meeting . the southern african state is one of the few countries within the au which has a military attache stationed in israel where it opened an embassy in 2015 . israel does not have an embassy in zambia . lungu paid a state visit to israel in february 2017 . the president was accompanied by a large delegation of ministers from his administration . after his return to zambia , lungu was quoted in the times as saying : israel is a pacesetter in survival instinct because it has a desert ; but they have a thriving education , agriculture and information and communication technology sectors and we can explore and learn from them . a lot of benefits are expected out of this trip . zambia is one of the few countries within the au which has a military attache stationed in israel where it opened an embassy in 2015 . unfortunately , no statement was recorded in the same publication which cites the plight of the palestinian people who share a similar history with africans as it relates to colonialism and imperialism . israel under successive leaders since 1948 has collaborated with the same white supremacist forces which conquered , exploited and oppressed african people and their descendants throughout the world . the times then quoted israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu while he was in kenya for the inauguration of kenyatta as emphasizing in regard to zambia that tel aviv s aim was to : deepen its cooperation with the country , which i think is important for both our countries and both our peoples . i know that you re opening a jewish history museum in zambia and soon a synagogue in the capital city . i hope one day i have the opportunity to visit those institutions and to visit zambia . africa and israel : a comparative history although jewish people were subjected to national discrimination in europe and the united states during the 19 th and 20 th centuries , today since the recognition of the state of israel by the united nations in may 1948 most people do not consider them to be an oppressed people . however , it is important to make a distinction between judaism as a religion and zionism as an ideology and political movement . in fact when the founders of the world zionist movement began in the later years of the 19 th century , its leaders specifically sought to align themselves with the rising tide of colonialism throughout asia and africa . during the early phase of the zionist movement palestine was not the only location examined for the establishment of a jewish state . ( see weizmann and smuts : a study in zionist - south african cooperation . institute for palestine studies monograph no . 43 , 1975 ) other areas considered by the zionists included territories in africa such as modern - day madagascar , uganda and libya . by 1917 , british foreign secretary lord balfour issued his famous declaration which mandated the creation of a state for the jewish and arab peoples in the - then colony of palestine . most historical literature on this territory prior to 1948 referred to the area as palestine . ( < URL > [ 2 ] ) nevertheless , when the state of israel was recognized by the un it was done so as exclusively a jewish state where millions of palestinians had been forcibly removed and disenfranchised . in 1948 , the un was dominated by the european colonial powers and the u . s . the soviet union , whose military had made the greatest contribution to breaking the expansionist program of the third reich under adolph hitler , also voted in the un to recognize the jewish state in palestine . palestine was not the only location examined for the establishment of a jewish state . the overwhelming number of colonies in africa did not gain their independence from european imperialism until after world war ii with the upsurge of national liberation movements in sudan , the gold coast ( ghana ) , algeria , tunisia , kenya , angola , southern rhodesia ( zimbabwe ) , northern rhodesia ( zambia ) , southwest africa ( namibia ) , etc . after the century - long existence of the atlantic slave trade which uprooted millions of africans from the continent to europe , north america , central america , the caribbean and south america , the advent of classic colonialism was imposed on the continent . during 1884 - 85 , the berlin west africa conference was held in germany . this gathering carved up africa among the imperialist powers . it would take over a century to bring about the independence of the continent with the republic of south africa overthrowing the racist apartheid system in 1994 . at present only the western sahara , the sahrawi arab democratic republic ( sadr ) , remains under the colonial control of the north african monarchy of morocco . africa and palestine solidarity after the 1956 suez canal war when britain , france and israel invaded egypt under president gamal abdel nasser in order to retake control of this strategic asset , the political sympathy of most african states has shifted solidly in the direction of the palestinian and other arab people . later , as a result of the egypt - jordan - syria wars with israel in 1967 and 1973 , a majority of independent african governments and national liberation movements broke relations with israel . the palestine liberation organization ( plo ) is viewed by progressive forces throughout africa as the de facto representatives of the people . after the signing of the oslo accords between israel and the plo in 1993 , which gave rise to the palestinian authority , there has been a period of thawing relations between tel aviv and some african states . however , african solidarity with palestine remains strong . the republic of south africa under the ruling african national congress ( anc ) continues to be a bulwark of sentiment in favor of the recognition of an independent palestinian state . this mood has existed in zimbabwe as well during the 37 - year presidency of robert mugabe , the former leader of the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party ( zanu - pf ) . after the signing of the oslo accords there has been a period of thawing relations between tel aviv and some african states . when on december 6 u . s . president donald trump issued his executive order to move the american embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem mass demonstrations in solidarity with the palestinian people have been held throughout the world . the three leading alliance partners in south africa , the anc , south african communist party ( sacp ) and the congress of south african trade unions ( cosatu ) have all issued statements decrying the policy decisions of trump . the u . s . government is the staunchest supporter of the state of israel providing billions of dollars in assistance and military hardware on an annual basis . egypt , due to military and political considerations ranks as the second largest recipient of direct aid from washington . however , africa as a whole can in no way compare to the economic , military and diplomatic support which is received by israel irrespective of the fact that people of african descent in the u . s . are numbered in excess of 40 million inhabitants . consequently , the holding of an israel - africa summit in zambia would represent a tremendous setback in the progressive legacy of independent states on the continent . at this critical stage in international relations au member countries should be intensifying their cooperation with other fraternal governments and peoples on the continent and indeed throughout the world . abayomi azikiwe is the editor of pan africa news wire .

" - - deuteronomy 30 : 19 ( nkjv ) on the crisp , sunny , fall columbus day in 1999 , organizers of the " say so " march approached the steps of the u . s . supreme court . the marchers , who were predominantly black pastors and lay persons , concluded their three - day protest at the site of two monumental cases : the school desegregation brown v . board of education ( 1954 ) and the pro - abortion roe v . wade " rights " in t he latter converged in the declaration of rev . johnny m . hunter , the march s sponsor and national director of life , education and resource network ( learn ) , the largest black pro - life organization . " civil rights doesn t mean anything without a right to life " declared hunter . he and the other marchers were protesting the disproportionately high number of abortions in the black community . the high number is no accident . many americans black and white are unaware of planned parenthood founder margaret sanger s negro project . sanger created this program in 1939 , after the organization changed its name from the american birth control league ( abcl ) to the birth control federation of america ( bcfa ) . the aim of the program was to restrict many believe exterminate the black population . under the pretense of " better health " and " family planning , " sanger cleverly implemented her plan . what s more shocking is sanger s beguilement of black america s cr me de la cr me those prominent , well educated and well - to - do into executing her scheme . some within the black elite saw birth control as a means to attain economic empowerment , elevate the race and garner the respect of whites . the negro project has had lasting repercussions in the black community : " we have become victims of genocide by our own hands , " cried hunter at the " say so " march . malthusian eugenics margaret sanger aligned herself with the eugenicists whose ideology prevailed in the early 20 th century . eugenicists strongly espoused racial supremacy and " purtiy " , " particularly of the " aryan " race . eugenicists hoped to purify the bloodlines and improve the race by encouraging the " fit " to reproduce and the " unfit " to restrict their reproduction . they sought to contain the " inferior " races through segregation , sterilization , birth control and abortion . sanger embraced malthusian eugenics . thomas robert malthus , a 19 th century cleric and professor of political economy , believed a population time bomb threatened the existence of the human race . he viewed social problems such as poverty , deprivation and hunger as evidence of this " population crisis . " according to writer george grant , malthus condemned charities and other forms of benevolence , because he believed they only exacerbated the problems . his answer was to restrict population growth of certain groups of people . his theories of population growth and economic stability became the basis for national and international social policy . grant quotes from malthus magnum opus , an essay on the principle of population , published in six editions from 1798 to 1826 : all children born , beyond what would be required to keep up the population to a desired level , must necessarily perish , unless room is made for them by the deaths of grown persons . we should facilitate , instead of foolishly and vainly endeavoring to impede , the operations of nature in producing this mortality . malthus disciples believed if western civilization were to survive , the physically unfit , the materially poor , the spiritually diseased , the racially inferior , and the mentally incompetent had to be suppressed and isolated or even , perhaps , eliminated . his disciples felt the subtler and more " scientific " approaches of education , contraception , sterilization and abortion were more " practical and acceptable ways " to ease the pressures of the alleged overpopulation . critics of malthusianism said the group " produced a new vocabulary of mumbo - jumbo . it was all hard - headed , scientific and relentless . " further , historical facts have proved the malthusian mathematical scheme regarding overpopulation to be inaccurate , though many still believe them . despite the falsehoods of malthus overpopulation claims , sanger nonetheless immersed herself in malthusian eugenics . grant wrote she argued for birth control using the " scientifically verified " threat of poverty , sickness , racial tension and overpopulation as its background . sanger s publication , the birth control review ( founded in 1917 ) regularly published pro - eugenic articles from eugenicists , such as ernst ruin . although sanger ceased editing the birth control review in 1929 , the abcl continued to use it as a platform for eugenic ideas . sanger built the work of the abcl , and , ultimately , planned parenthood , on the ideas and resources of the eugenics movement . grant reported that " virtually all of the organization s board members were eugenicists . " eugenicists financed the early projects , from the opening of birth control clinics to the publishing of " revolutionary " literature . eugenicists comprised the speakers at conferences , authors of literature and the providers of services " almost without the exception . " and planned parenthood s international work was originally housed in the offices of the eugenics society . the two organizations were intertwined for years . the abcl became a legal entity on april 22 , 1922 , in new york . before that , sanger illegally operated a birth control clinic in october 1916 , in the brownsville section of brooklyn , new york , which eventually closed . the clinic serviced the poor immigrants who heavily populated the area those deemed " unfit " to reproduce . sanger s early writings clearly reflected malthus influence . she writes : organized charity itself is the symptom of a malignant social disease . those vast , complex , interrelated organizations aiming to control and to diminish the spread of misery and destitution and all the menacing evils that spring out of this sinisterly fertile soil , are the surest sign that our civilization has bred , is breeding and perpetuating constantly increasing numbers of defectives , delinquents and dependents .
why we oppose planned parent hood ( the following is a reprint of the stopp ' s essay " why we oppose planned parenthood " ) planned parenthood is not a benevolent organization trying to strengthen women ' s rights . it is a cold , calculating group intent on spreading the humanist religion , luring our children into their web of premarital sex and unlimited abortions , reducing the population of minorities in particula and filling its coffers with the profits from sales of birth control devices . pp comes between parents children planned parenthood pushes what it calls confidential services for minors , meaning that pp will provide all types of reproductive services to young girls , including potentially dangerous prescription medication and invasive surgery , without their parents knowledge . in its 1993 - 1994 annual report , pp bragged of its unswerving commitment to confidentiality . in most states , pp assigns teens a code name so that pp can call the girls at home and pretend to be a girlfriend . ( recently , the code names in springfield , il ; chicago , il ; and kingston , ny ; were heather , nancy and lucy , respectively . ) as long ago as 1979 , the sunday independent newspaper in wilkes - barre , pa , reported that planned parenthood was transporting high school girls out of town , during school hours , to get abortions without the parents being notified . planned parenthood will give minor girls norplant , depo - provera shots , and even abortions without their parents knowledge . pp does not oppose teenage seX planned parenthood does not view teenage sex as wrong . pp is upset only if sex results in unwanted births . planned parenthood s sex education programs are not about telling children how to avoid sex . they are , rather , designed to indoctrinate our children into what pp calls responsible sexuality . by this pp means it is okay for kids to have sex as long as they avoid pregnancy ; or if they do get pregnant , have an abortion . former pp president faye wattleton confirmed this in the los angeles times , on october 17 , 1986 : [ planned parenthood is ] not going to be an organization promoting celibacy or chastity . the current pp president , pamela maraldo , in an article in the march / april 1993 issue of family planning world , condemned abstinence - only sex ed programs as unacceptable . she endorsed , instead , the position of former united states surgeon general joycelyn elders , who said , we ve taught our children in driver s education what to do in the front seat , and now we ve got to teach them what to do in the back seat . pp spreads religion of humanism planned parenthood is dedicated to spreading the religious doctrine of humanism as defined in the humanist manifestos ( i ii ) . pp has consistently refused to give our children a clear message of right and wrong . it seeks not to educate our children in moral values , but to indoctrinate them into the humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code , and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual . in the los angeles times article quoted above , faye wattleton said , [ planned parenthood s ] concern is not to convey shoulds or should nots . fearing that moral people on school boards may lead to schools teaching our young children right from wrong , pamela maraldo said , in the article referred to above , . . . we must bring an immediate halt to the aggressive infiltration of local school boards by the religious right . any school program endorsed by planned parenthood will give children complete information on how to have sex . the children will be given no moral guidance in a pp program and will be told they can do it or not do it depending on how they feel . while this concept of no absolute rights or wrongs may be embraced by some people in the world , it is rejected by most . most people subscribe to religious principles that recognize a supreme authority over life and a set of divinely inspired principles on which our behavior must be conditioned . parents who support stopp are among this latter group and , therefore , oppose all pp programs for teens . pp poses a danger to women planned parenthood runs a business providing birth control devices to its customers . although pp is officially a non - profit organization , irs regulations allow it to make profits on parts of its operation . pp does make a profit on its sale of birth control devices and seems to operate more to protect that income than its clients . a primary example of this is their provision of birth control pills . the pill has long been a major income producer for pp . at the third annual aids conference in washington in june 1987 , dr . frank plummer of the kenya medical institute reported that oral contraceptive users appear to be less resistant to aids than non - users . still pp refused to get teenage girls and others off the pill . then , family planning perspectives ( vol . 25 , no . 6 , p . 243 ) reported : women who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and use the pill are more likely than nonusers to have hiv present in their cervical secretions , and may be more likely to infect their sexual partners . the agi story goes on to say : the presence of hiv in cervical secretions was nearly 12 times as likely among pill users as among non - users . still , pp refused to tell its customers to get off the pill to reduce the risk of aids . if pp were really concerned about women , it would stop selling the pill . however , this would mean about an 85 , 000 , 000 decrease in pp income . this same disregard for women can also be seen in planned parenthood s handling of the norplant problem . in 1993 and 1994 , numerous lawsuits were filed by norplant users over the side effects of the implants and the difficulty of removal . yet pp not only continues to make this device available , it still implants it in minors without parental knowledge . continue to page 2

most people s pets are a member of the family and , as is the case with dogs and cats , they love their owners unconditionally . other types of pets may not be quite so affectionate or even terribly aware of their owners , which makes what this lizard did so shocking . who knew that lizards could actually communicate with humans texas resident aaron roman shared the amazing video of his reptile s reaction to aaron s wave , which he caught on video . it appears that the lizard , named evan , is waving back aaron gave a brief wave towards evan to make sure he was doing okay since the bearded dragon wasn t moving much . imagine his surprise when the lizard gave a wave of okay right back at him . aaron explained : i had gotten evan for my birthday . one day i walked into my room and saw that he wasn t moving much . i tried seeing if he d moved by waving at him , but little did i know that he d wave back at me . i tried keeping it cool for the video . interestingly , though it appears that evan is giving his owner a friendly greeting , it s actually a show of submission that lizards will display when a larger lizard is nearby . comments flooded in on facebook posts about the waving lizard video , with one person pointing out some tough love : yeah . pretty sure they wave to ward off a threat so jokes on you , your lizard doesn t love you , it hates you . another commenter gave a lengthy explanation about the lizard s wave , writing : people forget that animals have like a million meanings for different behavior . the reasons that a bearded dragon will wave their arm is not entirely explained . however , it does seem to be a form of communication . a common belief is that arm waving is a passive message , to indicate submission when a larger or more dominant beardie is nearby . so , he is acknowledging your dominance , which is healthy ; you re the one who knows where the food is . in this case , you don t really need to reply ; he s essentially being polite . the commenter continued to list reasons for the lizard waving , explaining : one meaning is species recognition . if a bearded dragon waves at another bearded dragon , it tells the other dragon that he / she is aware of their presence . young bearded dragons may do a slow wave with one of their arms to signal , i m just a baby don t hurt me your young beardie may even do this when he sees you walking up to him if he is intimidated by you we have to remember that even reptiles are not robots ; they have moods and personality quirks too that change over time . they added this viewpoint about the waving video : all in all , it can t hurt to wave back . at best , he ll be comforted ( you re being submissive too ) , at worst he ll be confused . they wave back and forth to each other quite frequently , so he may well appreciate a reply , even if he isn t expecting one .
dogs are fantastic . they provide so much joy in our lives . if you are lucky enough to have a pup in your household than you know how great it can be to come home to a happy fur - friend greeting you at the door . while they are a great addition to the family , dogs can also be a lot of work . they come with a list of daily responsibilities that are added to our already long - growing list of tasks . we have to feed them , walk them , take them to regular vet visits , and train them . for some dogs , training can be a bit more challenging , as certain breeds are more set in their ways than others . and then there are other dogs , who just have love certain holidays . the two dogs that you will see in the video below , happen to love christmas . in fact , they love the holiday so much that they put up a big fuss when their owner tries to finally get rid of the christmas tree . when this particular family was getting ready to have guests over they decided that it was time to toss their tree out , but it proved to be a much more challenging task than they had expected . it sounds simple take the tree out in the backyard and toss it over the fence and into the wooded area . well , if you have two christmas - tree loving dogs , this tasks is a lot harder than expected . the dogs want nothing to do with getting rid of the tree and they are doing their best to keep in their yard . as the owner is holding one end and attempting to throw it over the fence , the two dogs team up and grip the other end with their teeth , in a fierce game of tug of war . just when the owner appears to have a steadier grip on the tree , the dogs twist and turn and the owner gets sent over the tree , rolling onto his back on the ground . he gets up quickly , grabs the middle part of the tree and gets down in a squat position while using his whole body to pull the tree up and over the fence , but the dogs are determined to keep the tree in their grips . the owner falls down a second time , and just when he looks like he is going to give up , he lifts the tree one last time and manages to toss it over the fence , releasing the trunk from the dogs grip once and for all . the pups make it clear that they aren t fans of the tree being on the other side of the tree and they immediately stand up on their hind legs , lean against the tree and bark in refusal . these are two very determined dogs . owners shared their love of the video hilarious what great dogs they must have loved this tree in the house maybe the dogs loved being so close to nature in the comfort of their home and that s why they didn t want to see the tree go , or maybe they simply love a good game of tug of war .
the lion may be known as the king of the jungle , but lions do not live in jungles . they re the rulers of the african savannahs that are covered in brown grasses and speckled with sparse trees . lions coloring helps them blend in perfectly with the tall grass so they can ambush their prey as best as possible . and lions are ferocious . although they re one of the most powerful predators on land , lions are in danger . hunters and poachers target lions to prove to the world their machismo . and while hunters seek to wipe lions off the face of the earth to bolster their egos , the kevin richardson wildlife sanctuary hopes to stop them and protect the big african cat at all cost . richardson has earned the nickname the lion whisperer for a reason . he aims to educate the world about lions . and for those lucky enough to volunteer alongside richardson , he encourages them to learn more about lions and help protect the wild species . to raise awareness , kevin has now set up his youtube channel lionwhisperertv . the channel is all about raising awareness about not only the declining numbers of lions but also how this rapid decrease is happening . by watching these videos , you are directly contributing to our scheme of land acquisition , he writes in his bio . as part of the volunteer program , richardson hosts a volunteer enrichment and lion enrichment walk . as the name suggests , richardson takes his group of volunteers out into the savannah of south africa to hang out with two lions . there , the volunteers meet a male lion , bobcat , and a female lioness , gabby . both lions look ferocious , but are truly affectionate , at least that s what richardson says . and remember , he s the lion whisperer , so he s got an advantage with these deadly big cats . as richardson showers the pair of lions with love , the volunteers stay locked in the truck , unwilling to put their lives in danger . and while they are in the vehicle , the lions are just feet from them and if something goes wrong , they could wind up injured anyway . richardson shared the video on his the lion whisperer youtube channel . with more than one million hits , this video has proven to be one of his most famous . the video describes the moment caught on tape as follows : it s an enrichment walk for both the volunteers and the lions as kevin shows off his lovely lions as well as giving some amazing lion facts to the volunteers . viewers like you are overwhelmed with the magnificent footage . the following are a few comments shared on the video . i hope to someday volunteer there with kevin . i believe in the work and his perspective about conservation . this video makes me want to all the more bobcat and gabby are lovely lions . every time i watch a one of your videos i somehow end up smiling from ear to ear that was so beautiful , wish i could rub my head against a lion . take a moment to watch this video . would you ever want to volunteer with kevin richardson and his lions
stories of animal abuse are always tragic , but this one is absolutely devastating . in horrifying cell phone footage , posted to chinese social media platform , weibo , a man is seen beating his greyhound to death , screaming throughout the video . according to reports , the man slammed the dog to the ground and repeatedly beat it after he lost money after betting a fortune on the dog in a race and losing . he is even seen saying that he ll eat the dog , blood dripping from his hands , noting : listen up dog owners . if your dog is not in a good fit , eat it . at one point , he yells : you made me lose my money another person on the video explained that the man had spent a lot of money to buy the greyhound and bet a lot on the dog race and the animal lost . sadly , china doesn t have laws in place prohibiting animal torture , so even if the man was identified , he wouldn t face any consequences . not surprisingly , people who commented on the daily mirror s facebook post about the disturbing video were overwhelmingly angry and upset , with one person noting : i can t imagine many people will click on this , an absolute vile excuse for a man . i hope he has nothing but misery for the rest of his life . another commenter noted : absolutely heartbreaking . this has me in absolute tears this vile person needs to be shot it s people like him that give greyhound owners such a bad name and why so many people think all racing greys are treated so badly luckily most greyhounds have loving owners / trainers and find loving forever homes when their racing days are over both of my greys came from a greyhound adoption trust when they retired , perhaps they should start the same kinds of trusts in china to save these beautiful dogs . one commenter believed that the video was at least an important wake - up call to clue in those who are unaware with this type of cruelty exists , writing : thank you for bringing the cruelty involved in greyhound racing into the mainstream public awareness . thousands of these gentle dogs lose their lives every year because of this industry and many more suffer a life of social deprivation , kenneled for up to 23 hours a day . they also included some helpful information to find out more , noting : to find out the harsh consequences of betting on or attending dog racing for the hounds look at cagEd nationwide or birmingham greyhound protection pages or google it for yourself . another person couldn t even read the story , commenting : personally couldn t click to read the details as the simple thought of it was so sickening . the law is simply not severe enough for cruelty to animals and more severe sentencing must be introduced . a life is a life whether human or animal and more protection for animals is called for . another commenter added :
sarah huckabee sanders is a well - paid liar . day after day , she takes to the white house press briefing room to defend whatever ridiculous thing trump has done most recently . she s achieved infamy through her brazen willingness to state literally any absurdity with a straight face . today , sanders faced tough questions regarding the trump / russia scandal and ongoing investigation . after tensely attempting to change the subject several times , she finally let reporters know how she really felt . when questioned about trump s tweet regarding the lost fbi text messages , she told reporters exasperatedly , you guys are obsessed with collusion well , yeah , sarah . trump s criminal behavior matters an awful lot , considering his occupancy of the oval office . i think he thinks there is great cause for concern that five months worth of text messages have gone missing , particularly given the individual as part of that process has already been shown to be extremely biased against the president , and was involved it what seems to be some very inappropriate behavior , and that certainly is of great concern . you guys are absolutely obsessed with everything to do with collusion , if it has anything to do with the president . we hope that you ll take some of that same obsession , energy , and furor and direct it to some of the places it looks like there could have been some really inappropriate and possibly illegal behavior . here s the video : trump s tweet was referring to an fbi agent who had an affair with a lawyer who worked for the fbi . texts between the two showed anti - trump bias , so he was immediately fired from the mueller investigation . it s notable that it s perfectly fine for citizens to hold personal beliefs there has been absolutely no evidence of bias on the job or wrongdoing . he was fired to prevent it from even being remotely possible . robert mueller himself is a lifelong republican . the texts that were lost , that trump feels are so important , are five months of sexts as part of an affair . obviously the press is obsessed with collusion . where there is smoke , there is fire , and although dozens of connections between trump s campaign and russia have been reported , the fire in question is going to be private financial information that only official investigations will be able to acquire . these things take time , as does building and prosecuting a case . manafort has still not even been tried , for example this is far from over . not only that , but trump gets dirtier by the day . there s a good chance the payment he reportedly gave stormy daniels could have been illegal . the fbi texts only matter to right - wing press that has no goal other than to vindicate trump . sanders and conservatives care absolutely nothing for objective truth or justice . they have no motive beyond enabling trump and his criminal behavior . featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images
brian neale is the center for medicare medicaid services ( cms ) deputy administrator , and the director for the center for medicaid and chip services . neale is an ally of vice president mike pence and was appointed to his role in the medicaid program in march . he was the healthcare policy director under pence back when pence was the governor of indiana ( their relationship goes back even further than that ) , and he helped design indiana s medicaid expansion . in his role as a medicaid official in the federal government , he was a key factor in bringing about the work requirements that states are now allowed to require . with that goal accomplished , he s now stepping down . it s not too clear why , and no reasons have been stated , but it s likely that he wanted a key accomplishment under his belt before leaving the raging dumpster fire that is the trump administration . a year and then i m out has been a common mantra among high level trump appointees with exceptions . some , like stephen miller , appear to be in it for the long haul . others have not made it anywhere near a year . in any case , the trump administration has bled staff at a historically high rate . according to an internal staff memo obtained by inside health policy , neale , a closely ally of vice president mike pence , spent a year helping to craft the trump administration s new policy direction on medicaid , and reasons for his departure remain unclear . next month , brian will be leaving cms to pursue other opportunities , cms administrator seema verma wrote in the email to cms staff tuesday . he joins with many other high level trump appointees who have left the administration . featured image via mike theiler - pool / getty images

if you don t believe in fate , here s a story that s sure to change your mind . every morning , jake gerber goes to his local caf to grab a cup of coffee on his way to work . it s not the place where you typically find a once - in - a - lifetime love , but incredibly , the stars aligned for jake , and something amazing happened : he made up an entire personality for the woman who serves him coffee most days , and she s absolutely perfect for him . if you re not tearing up right now , you re essentially a robot . the connection between jake and the detailed personality he invented whole cloth for his barista was instantaneous . after making eye contact with the barista just once , he assumed she was the kind of girl who would want to walk home in bad weather just so she could dance in the rain , which is so refreshing because jake is looking for a woman to counterbalance his more anxious personality . and when jake noticed that she has more than one piercing per ear , he went ahead and decided that she is totally into the national , which just so happens to be his favorite band whoa jake s brain could have invented any personality for his barista , but to invent one that can totally appreciate the subtlety of the back half of trouble will find me what are the odds the universe must have conspired to bring jake to that coffee shop the first time , because how else can you explain that a barista who , according to jake s imagination , has a working map of westeros in her head just happened to be working there eerier still , one time a few weeks ago , jake said , it s just one of those days , while ordering his coffee , to which the barista replied , tell me about it , and jake interpreted that as a clear indication that she thought working for a corporate coffee shop was pretty lame but needed to pay the bills for art school , where she studies experimental painting but not the kind of experimental painting jake thinks is stupid . against all odds , he then managed to extrapolate from the way she smiles when she hands him his coffee that his barista enjoys a saturday in just watching movies , would impress his dad with her ping - pong skills when she comes to visit over thanksgiving , and totally sees the good in jake even though he s not great at parties and feels entitled to have his opinion constantly validated . seriously , how did jake manage to project a girl who checks all the boxes onto his everyday barista folks , love is real romantic comedies may not be realistic , but the electric connection jake feels with the personality he s given to the barista based off zero evidence is right out of hollywood . and it s truly lucky that jake has fallen for this completely fabricated idea of a woman who has been right under his nose this whole time , because in reality , the barista is nothing like he imagines and has never thought about him even once . wow . after hearing a beautiful story like this , who knows maybe there s hope for us after all

water cooler 1 / 25 / 18 open thread ; fake news cnn still won t correct fake story ; feminists demand feminist science ; grumpy cat goes to court of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next if you are upset about being called fake news , you might just try not printing it . cnn has arguably been the biggest source of questionable attack journalism directed at the current administration , and without argument the biggest crybaby when it comes to the administration pointing out their problems and poor reporting . contrary to what some people may say , the press and politicians attacking each other with words is not a constitutional crisis matter of fact it s one of the ways you know things are working properly in our little republic . the time to worry is when the politicians and the press just have nice things to say about each other . either way , it s the citizens that decide what s what , what s important and what s fake , and if cnn want s to make the case they are the victim they could try correcting and apologizing for false stories in a timely fashion , unlike this one . nearly seven months after falsely accusing president donald trump of getting the facts wrong on classified information that former federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) director james comey leaked after he was fired , cnn still hasn t corrected its false story on the matter . on the heels of numerous other false stories published or broadcast by the cable network , the latest failure of the network to correct false reporting raises serious questions about its commitment to accuracy . last july , trump blasted comey on twitter for leaking classified information . james comey leaked classified information to the media . that is so illegal cnn s jake tapper , however , took issue with trump s statement , and wrote the following lede and supporting paragraphs in a cnn story accusing the president of peddling false information about the nature of the information leaked by james comey after he was fired by the president : as it turns out , however , the information leaked by comey was classified , and the records in his possession were clearly government records which comey was not authorized to possess or distribute . how do we know the information was classified because the fbi itself told congress as much . in fact , the information leaked by comey was so sensitive that members of congress were not even allowed to read the memos he wrote outside of a special compartmented information facility , or scif , a highly secure room or area designed to prevent classified information consumed within from being improperly distributed . the federalist jake tapper not understanding our nations rather involved rules for classification of government documents is understandable . cnn complaining it gets unfairly labeled fake news when it won t fix the story well that s at best whiny and it does raise the question why are they willing to keep this out there feminist science , if that reads wrong to you pat yourself on the back well i hope they will be purging that horrible misogynist sodium soon . he has been getting free pass forever , same with his buddy hydrogen and maybe helium will get some of the credit she so rightly deserves . sorry hard to write seriously about people trying attach our petty squabbles to things that aren t even aware we exist . unfortunately that s just what is happening at uc santa cruz of course science is now under siege by sjws , because that s what they do . for example , see the event being held at uc santa cruz titled research justice 101 : tools for feminist science . yes , feminist science . the event description reads : participants will be challenged to apply principles and practices of justice to their own work , interrogating questions such as : who benefits who is harmed who is most vulnerable and ultimately , who do we do science for , and why the workshop will conclude with practical skills and resources for participants to push their research communities to be more inclusive , equitable and attentive to social justice . the event is being organized by an los angeles - based group titled sigh free radicals . according to the college fix : the mission of the free radicals is to enact political and social change by advocating scientists think through the hidden assumptions in their methodological approaches and challenges researchers to think more deeply about the political implications of their work , its website states . got that they want scientists to only undertake studies and only publish conclusions that will support a radical feminist worldview . pjmedia i can only hope the people promoting this will one day be treated by doctors who were fully indoctrinated in the precepts and with drugs that were made by people who were more worried about political correctness than efficacy . he s not just grumpy he has a lawyer . if you thought grumpy cat was just another cute feline , think again . a cat made famous online because of its permanent scowl has been awarded 710 , 000 ( 500 , 000 ) in a copyright case by a california federal court . grumpy cat limited sued the owners of us coffee company grenade for exceeding an agreement over the cat s image . the company only had rights to use the cat to sell its grumppuccino iced drink , but sold other grumpy products . the cat , real name tardar sauce , went viral in 2012 after photographs of her sour expression emerged online . originally posted on the social website reddit by the brother of the cat s owner , tabatha bundesen , the image of the cat quickly spread as a meme with funny text captions . in 2013 grenade beverage , owned by father and son nick and paul sandford , struck a 150 , 000 deal to market iced coffee beverages with the cat s scowl on its packaging . but in 2015 grumpy cat limited sued them for breaching that contract . a court filing claimed they had exceeded the deal by selling roasted coffee and grumppucino t -

veteran commentator calls out the growing ethnonationalism at fox news ( and it s so ugly ) of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next let s be honest : this is pretty much all of fox news commentary portion now , since the network became trump pravda . commentator and the weekly standard founder , bill kristol , sat for an interview with cnbc that was released on thursday . among various topics , he noted how tucker carlson , a fox news superstar , has changed since he began with the weekly standard . speaking of carlson s fox news show : i mean , it is close now to racism , white i mean , i don t know if it s racism exactly but ethnonationalism of some kind , let s call it . a combination of dumbing down , as you said earlier , and stirring people s emotions in a very unhealthy way , kristol told cnbc s john harwood in the interview published on thursday . carlson has been getting a bit of attention lately from some who are seeing exactly what kristol is talking about . no , carlson isn t dipping to the level of sean hannity , or other conspiracy - pushing Magadooks , but some of his work has a toe on the line . kristol went on to praise carlson s early work . tucker carlson was a great young reporter . he was one of the most gifted 24 - year - olds i ve seen in the 20 years that i edited the magazine . his copy was sort of perfect at age 24 , kristol said . he had always a little touch of pat buchananism , i would say , paleo - conservativism . compare that to what he s devolved to , while working in the toxic , propaganda atmosphere of fox news . carlson recently questioned the widespread outrage over trump s reported comments referring to african nations as sh * thole countries . so , if you say norway is a better place to live and haiti is kind of a hole , well anyone who s been to those countries or has lived in them would agree . but we re jumping up and down , oh , you can t say that . why can t you say that carlson asked . because trump s comments weren t that simple . he wrapped up the people in the comment when he asked why we couldn t get more immigrants from norway . he didn t ask which place was nicer to visit . when trump made the comment , he did so to appeal to a base that is packed full of alt - right , white nationalists , anti - semites , and neo - nazis ( not all , but far too many to just ignore ) . reports are that he called associates and said he thought the comments would appeal to his base . so yes , even though some have played the blind , deaf , and dumb case of , i don t recall , it s clear he said it . and it was wrong . kristol is right to point out what is happening over at fox news , as well as to call out those that are falling into the alt - right line of scumbaggery . this isn t something that we should allow any national news network to make mainstream . the post veteran commentator calls out the growing ethnonationalism at fox news ( and it s so ugly ) appeared first on redstate . source : < URL >

scientists move doomsday clock ahead by 30 seconds , closest to apocalypse since 1953 as of today , it is two minutes to midnight headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next desdemona despair by lindsey bever , sarah kaplan , and abby ohlheiser 25 january 2018 ( the washington post ) alexa , what time is the apocalypse ulp . the bulletin of the atomic scientists advanced the symbolic doomsday clock a notch closer to the end of humanity thursday , moving it ahead by 30 seconds after what the organization called a grim assessment of the state of geopolitical affairs . as of today , bulletin president rachel bronson told reporters , it is two minutes to midnight . in moving the clock 30 seconds closer to the hour of the apocalypse , the group cited the failure of president trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change . the organization whose board includes 15 nobel laureates now believes the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago ; it is as threatening as it has been since world war ii , bulletin officials lawrence m . krauss and robert rosner wrote in an op - ed published thursday by the washington post . in fact , the doomsday clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953 , when cold war fears perhaps reached their highest levels . krauss , a theoretical physicist , and rosner , an astrophysicist , added : to call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy . north korea s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017 , increasing risks for itself , other countries in the region and the united states . the clock , a metaphorical measure of humankind s proximity to global catastrophe , also advanced 30 seconds last year , to 2 minutes to midnight the closest to the apocalyptic hour it has been since 1953 , after the united states tested its first thermonuclear device , followed months later by the soviet union s hydrogen bomb test . before thursday s announcement , experts said there was only one direction the clock could possibly move , given recent events including north korea s intercontinental ballistic missile test and the my - nuclear - button - is - bigger - than - yours war of words between trump and north korean leader kim jong un . i think it would be very hard for the clock not to move forward , alex wellerstein , who specializes in the history of nuclear weapons at the stevens institute of technology , said in an email leading up to the announcement . we have members of congress , white house advisers , and even the president implying that they think war with a nuclear state is not only likely , but potentially desirable . that s unusual and disturbing . the question i have is : how much forward can they go another 30 seconds , to be exact . [ more ] the doomsday clock just moved : it s now 2 minutes to midnight , the symbolic hour of the apocalypse by lawrence krauss and robert rosner 25 january 2018 ( the washington post ) days after donald trump took the oath of office , the bulletin of the atomic scientists reset the doomsday clock to 2 minutes to midnight , in part because of destabilizing comments and threats from america s new commander in chief . one year later , we are moving the clock forward again by 30 seconds , due to the failure of president trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change . the science and security board for the bulletin of the atomic scientists assesses that the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago ; it is as threatening as it has been since world war ii . in fact , the doomsday clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953 , when cold war fears perhaps reached their highest levels . to call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy . north korea s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017 , increasing risks for itself , other countries in the region and the united states . the failure in 2017 to secure a temporary freeze on north korea s nuclear development was unsurprising to observers of the downward spiral of nuclear rhetoric between trump and north korean leader kim jong un . but north korea s developing nuclear program will reverberate not just in the asia - pacific , as neighboring countries review their security options , but more widely , as all countries consider the costs and benefits of the international framework of nonproliferation treaties and agreements . global nuclear risks were compounded by u . s . - russia relations that now feature more conflict than cooperation . the united states and russia remained at odds , continuing military exercises along the borders of the north atlantic treaty organization , undermining the intermediate - range nuclear forces treaty , upgrading their nuclear arsenals and eschewing arms control negotiations . tensions over the south china sea have increased . pakistan and india have continued to build ever - larger arsenals of nuclear weapons . and in the middle east , uncertainty about continued u . s . support for the landmark iranian nuclear deal adds to a bleak overall picture . a related danger is the rise of cyberthreats targeting national infrastructure , including power grids , water supplies and military systems . on the climate - change front , the danger may seem less immediate than risk of nuclear annihilation , but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now . global carbon dioxide emissions have not yet shown the beginnings of the sustained decline toward zero that must occur if we are to avoid ever - greater warming . the nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse - gas emissions to manage even the climate risk accepted in the paris accord . so far , the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge . the trump administration s decision essentially to turn a blind eye to climate change transpired against a backdrop of a worsening climate , including exceedingly powerful hurricanes in the caribbean and other parts of north america and extreme heat waves in australia , south america , asia , europe and california . the arctic ice cap achieved its smallest - ever winter maximum in 2017 . and last week , data from 2017 demonstrated a continued trend of exceptional global warmth . we believe that the perilous world security situation described here would , in itself , justify moving the minute hand of the doomsday clock closer to midnight . but there also is a real threat posed by a fundamental breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent u . s . actions . in 2017 , the united states backed away from its long - standing leadership role in the world , reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges . neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict u . s . actions or discern between sincere u . s . pronouncements and mere rhetoric . u . s . allies have needed reassurance about american intentions more than ever . instead , they have been force to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from an administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals and suffering from turnover in senior leadership . led by an undisciplined and disruptive president , the administration has failed to develop , coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy . this inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence , alliance management and global stability . we hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant : an urgent warning of global danger . the time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past . the time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now . it is time to rewind the doomsday clock . we re as close to doomsday today as we were during the cold war washington , d . c . , 25 january 2018 ( bulletin of the atomic scientists ) citing growing nuclear risks and unchecked climate dangers , the iconic doomsday clock is now 30 seconds closer to midnight , the closest to the symbolic point of annihilation that the clock has been since 1953 at the height of the cold war . the decision announced today to move the doomsday clock to two minutes before midnight was made by the bulletin of the atomic scientists science and security board in consultation with the board of sponsors , which includes 15 nobel laureates . the full text of the doomsday clock statement is available at < URL > and includes key recommendations about how to rewindthedoomsdayclock . video from the doomsday clock announcement at the national press club in washington , d . c . , is available at < URL > and on the bulletin of the atomic scientists facebook page at < URL > the statement explaining the resetting of the time of the doomsday clock notes : in 2017 , world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change , making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago and as dangerous as it has been since world war ii . the greatest risks last year arose in the nuclear realm . north korea s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017 , increasing risks for itself , other countries in the region , and the united states . hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions on both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation . on the climate change front , the danger may seem less immediate , but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now . the nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse gas emissions to keep climate risks manageable , and so far , the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge . fueling concerns about the potential of a nuclear holocaust are a range of u . s . - russian military entanglements , south china sea tensions , escalating rhetoric between pakistan and india , and uncertainty about continued u . s . support for the iran nuclear deal . contributing to the risks of nuclear and non - nuclear clashes around the globe are the rise of nation - state information technology and internet - based campaigns attacking infrastructure and free elections , according to the statement . also highlighted as an overarching global concern : the decline of u . s . leadership and a related demise of diplomacy under the trump administration . [ t ] here has also been a breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent u . s . actions . in 2017 , the united states backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world , reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges . neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict u . s . actions or understand when u . s . pronouncements are real , and when they are mere rhetoric . international diplomacy has been reduced to name - calling , giving it a surrealistic sense of unreality that makes the world security situation ever more threatening . in january 2017 , the doomsday clock s minute hand edged forward by 30 seconds , to two and half minutes before midnight . for the first time , the doomsday clock was influenced by statements from an incoming u . s . president , donald trump , regarding the proliferation and the prospect of actually using nuclear weapons , as well as statements made in opposition to u . s . commitments regarding climate change . rachel bronson , president and ceo , bulletin of the atomic scientists , said : because of the extraordinary danger of the current moment , the science and security board today moves the minute hand of the doomsday clock 30 seconds closer to catastrophe . it is now two minutes to midnight the closest the clock has ever been to doomsday , and as close as it was in 1953 , at the height of the cold war . lawrence krauss , director of the origins project at arizona state university , foundation professor at school of earth and space exploration and physics department , arizona state university , and chair , bulletin of the atomic scientists board of sponsors , said : the current , extremely dangerous state of world affairs need not be permanent . the means for managing dangerous technology and reducing global - scale risk exist ; indeed , many of them are well - known and within society s reach , if leaders pay reasonable attention to preserving the long - term prospects of humanity , and if citizens demand that they do so . this is a dangerous time , but the danger is of our own making . humankind has invented the implements of apocalypse ; so can it invent the methods of controlling and eventually eliminating them . this year , leaders and citizens of the world can move the doomsday clock and the world away from the metaphorical midnight of global catastrophe by taking common - sense action . robert rosner , william e . wrather distinguished service professor in the department of astronomy and astrophysics and physics at the university of chicago , and chair , bulletin of the atomic scientists science and security board , said : we hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant as an urgent warning of global danger . the time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past . the time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now : rewindthedoomsdayclock . sharon squassoni , research professor of practice at the institute for international science and technology policy , elliott school of international affairs , the george washington university , and bulletin of the atomic scientists science and security board , said : in the past year , u . s . allies have needed reassurance about american intentions more than ever . instead , they have been forced to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from a u . s . administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals , suffering from turnover in senior leadership , led by an undisciplined and disruptive president , and unable to develop , coordinate , and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy . this inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence , alliance management , and global stability . it has made the existing nuclear risks greater than necessary and added to their complexity . sivan kartha , senior scientist at the stockholm environmental institute and co - leader of sei s gender and social equity program , and bulletin of the atomic scientists science and security board , said : 2017 just clocked in as the hottest year on record that wasn t boosted by an el nino . and that matches what we ve witnessed on the ground : the caribbean suffered a season of historic damage from exceedingly powerful hurricanes , extreme heat waves struck across the globe , the arctic ice cap hit its lowest winter peak on record , and the u . s . suffered devastating wildfires . and while this was happening , the trump administration dutifully carried through on the campaign promise of derailing u . s . climate policy , putting avowed climate denialists in top cabinet positions , and announcing plans to withdraw from the paris climate agreement . thankfully , this didn t cause global cooperation to unravel , and other countries have reaffirmed their commitment to take action against climate change . rewindthedoomsdayclock is a major message of the 2018 statement , with the following action steps among those recommended : u . s . president donald trump should refrain from provocative rhetoric regarding north korea , recognizing the impossibility of predicting north korean reactions . the u . s . and north korean governments should open multiple channels of communication . the world community should pursue , as a short - term goal , the cessation of north korea s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests . north korea is the only country to violate the norm against nuclear testing in 20 years . the trump administration should abide by the terms of the joint comprehensive plan of action for iran s nuclear program unless credible evidence emerges that iran is not complying with the agreement or iran agrees to an alternative approach that meets u . s . national security needs . the united states and russia should discuss and adopt measures to prevent peacetime military incidents along the borders of nato . u . s . and russian leaders should return to the negotiating table to resolve differences over the inf treaty , to seek further reductions in nuclear arms , to discuss a lowering of the alert status of the nuclear arsenals of both countries , to limit nuclear modernization programs that threaten to create a new nuclear arms race , and to ensure that new tactical or low - yield nuclear weapons are not built , and existing tactical weapons are never used on the battlefield . u . s . citizens should demand , in all legal ways , climate action from their government . climate change is a real and serious threat to humanity . governments around the world should redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they go well beyond the initial , inadequate pledges under the paris agreement . the international community should establish new protocols to discourage and penalize the misuse of information technology to undermine public trust in political institutions , in the media , in science , and in the existence of objective reality itself . contact patrick mitchell , ( 703 ) 276 -

why sandwiches must be banned of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next never mind transportation and power generation . we can address the global warming crisis by having the united nations ban sandwiches : researchers at the university of manchester calculated the carbon footprint of 40 different types of sandwiches both home - made and pre - packaged taking account how the ingredients were produced , the packaging , as well as food waste discarded at home and elsewhere in the supply chain . professor adisa azapagic , from the university s school of chemical engineering and analytical sciences , said : given that sandwiches are a staple of the british diet as well as their significant market share in the food sector , it is important to understand the contribution from this sector to the emissions of greenhouse gases . for example , consuming 11 . 5 billion sandwiches annually in the uk generates , on average , 9 . 5 million tonnes of co2 eq , equivalent to the annual use of 8 . 6 million cars . next , the experts will issue an official report on precisely how many angels can dance on the head of a pin . although banning sandwiches would be ideal , eating stale sandwiches instead of fresh ones could help save the planet . the [ british sandwich association ] estimates that extending the shelf life of sandwiches could reduce waste by more than 2 , 000 tonnes a year . prof azapagic said : we need to change the labelling of food to increase the use - by date as these are usually quite conservative . so the sandwich is dried out and chewy ; it won t necessarily make you sick . do your part for the planet and shun fresh sandwiches , until progressives acquire the political leverage to ban sandwiches altogether . on a tip from kirklesworth . source : < URL >

tuesday brought bombshell after bombshell in reports on the rapidly growing mueller investigation . oddly silent , the president never mentioned nor even attempted to spin the explosive revelations on twitter . instead he focused on spinning more evidence of the booming economy he s created . according to news reports , mueller has now interviewed a key member of trump s inner circle , attorney general jeff sessions , further interviews were conducted with former fBi director james comey and former acting attorney general sally yates . an even bigger bombshell was dropped when reports revealed that mueller is also interested in questions around the day trump summoned former acting fBi director andrew mccabe to the oval office to ask him who he voted for in 2016 . these are all massively consequential revelations , but trump has had nothing to say about any of them . even more odd , not to mention heartless , is trump s failure to acknowledge the eleventh school shooting of 2018 ( 11 school shootings in 23 days ) in marshall county , kentucky . two were killed and several more injured , but the president has had nothing to say about the tragedy . perhaps he believes the country no longer needs a president who acknowledges real issues as long as he can convince everyone they re going to get rich any day now . twitter was not impressed with trump s bragging and turned his misleading tweet on its head with some statistics and news stories of their own . read some of their best responses below : featured image via getty / pool
kelly benzel was looking for a new best friend . she wanted a new dog . and instead of going to a pet shop that gathers dogs from disturbing puppy mills , benzel wanted to help a dog that had suffered in the past . so she went to her local rescue shelter and sought out a dog that had suffered animal abuse . she wanted to give the canine a second chance and shower it with the love it deserved . benzel fell in love with a white pit bull mix named rocco . she knew he would be the perfect dog for her . but before she was able to adopt him , she did not get a chance to meet the dog s previous owner . she was merely told that the dog s previous owners had possessed him for only a few months . although she did not know the dog s history , benzel was overjoyed to show rocco a new life with her . but as she was driving away with the dog , she knew that something was severely wrong . rocco was emitting a disturbing and potent odor . it smelled so bad , benzel could not even keep driving . she pulled over to go take a closer look at rocco . when she saw what it was , she was utterly shocked . the pit bull mix had a long laceration on his neck that the previous owner had hidden with the dog harness . the gash was six inches deep and one and a half inches deep . and kelly could tell by the smell that it was infected . instead of going home , benzel turned around and headed straight for the animal hospital . the vet helped rocco . he was bandaged and given the right medicines . and he was on the road to recovery . but his injury did not have to happen . benzel learned that he had been forced to wear his harness all the time since he was young . the material had cut into his flesh , and his skin had grown around it . he was so neglected that harness had embedded in his skin . benzel refused to let her new best friend go without getting justice . she called the seller up and told them about the problem . that shady person then tried to bribe her by saying the previous owner would cover the medical expenses and that she shouldn t worry . but benzel wanted justice for rocco . after intense neglect , she knew he deserved that much . that s when she hung up the phone and called the police . the owners played dumb . they pretended not to have known the dog was severely injured . and they said they only used the harness to keep rocco from running away . the justice system smelled the lies . the previous owners were slammed with mistreatment of animals charge . and then they were forced to fork over a 1 , 500 fine for their horrible treatment of the dog . benzel and rocco are now living happily together , and the dog s health is back where it should be . hats off to benzel for seeking justice for this dog . she did the right thing .
animal rescue workers in california received an unusual call near the end of december 2017 . in a dumpster , bystanders found a very weird - looking animal . and when they arrived at the scene to help it out , they found that it was a female bear cub that was utterly hairless after losing it all . now that the cub , who has since been named eve , is under the care of the bear league rescue group , which is in homewood , california , she is getting the care she needs to get her health back on track . the rescue group said that female cub lost her hair because of a bad case of mange . and when she was taken in , she was rushed to emergency care for an entire week . and at the end of it , they saved her life . but if she hadn t been taken to the bear league rescue group , she might not have made it . we ve seen this condition before , it seems to result from the cub s mother being killed early in the season and then the very small young one tries desperately to make it on their own but goes hungry most of the time , the bear league said in a facebook post . their immune system is therefore terribly compromised , and they succumb to mange and stunted growth . after bear league helped get the bear out of the emergency state , volunteers with california department of fish and wildlife arrived to transport the hairless bear cub to the fund for animals wildlife center in san diego county . the bear league said : a couple of compassionate and dedicated wildlife volunteers drove this little girl down to the center on the day before christmas . though we told them we don t name our patients , they had decided that she deserved a name and called her eve in honor of the holiday . she was being given a special gift for christmas . she would now have a warm , safe place to heal . when the little bear arrived , caretakers took her in and are focusing on helping her gain weight so she can get back on the track of good health . rescuer workers believe the cub is about a year old . and if she regrows her hair as they expect , she will eventually be released back into the wild . the bear league has taken a solid interest in the hairless black bear cub . and a few days before this writing , they shared an update to their facebook page that read : our little bare - bear is doing great she is a hearty eater and so far has not been picky at all . she is responding well to enrichment items , and so far she has adjusted well to her new environment . she will need to remain in the medical ward for now , where we can sanitize her room , and we have the ability to keep her away from inclement weather and keep her on heat during our chilly nights . what do you think about this little hairless black bear cub do you think she ll make a full recovery
arachniphobia is probably one of the most prevalent phobias out there . it is a hard question to answer with hard numbers , as phobias are not easily understood by those who have yet to face all their fears . while many claim to have a fear of heights or an aversion to tight spaces , neither of these predispositions are as predominant as a fear of spiders . but here is the thing : many people probably don t even know they have arachniphoabia . why is this because they have not yet come face - to - face with a spider that really can give them nightmares . let all of this change today as you face your fears and observe one of the most disgusting and scary bugs on the planet . footage of a south american beetle has been shared across the internet , and it has got many people more grossed out than ever before . the footage was posted by a japanese bug enthusiast who thought it worthwhile to post the movements of this disturbing beetle . while we don t mind observing nature in it s natural habitat , this just takes it to a whole other level if you though all of nature s creatures are beautiful , you should really check this face - eating bug out to see what nature is really capable of . the creature is known as the puppa of a hercules beetle . it is born in the forests or the undergrowth and spends the first two years of it s life where it should remain : out of site . it feats on rotten and dying wood for the majority of it s first two years of life , before gathering the strength to lock itself in a cocoon and grow an exoskeleton . the exoskeleton is the outer shell of the creative that helps it develop protection and strength as it develops . slowly the creature grows into a larger form and emerges out of the cocoon when it is at full strength and maximum creepy - ness . in it s full adult form it has huge pincers and can grow to over 6 . 7 inches we have the footage from the twitter feed of ziya tong , a japanese - canadian nature journalist specializes in the most odd creatures that roam the earth . woah . this is the puppa of the hercules beetle , he wrote . like something right out of aliens . and it moves the reaction to his post was not met with resounding excitement and curiosity to say the least . one twitter follower wrote : whatever it is Kill it with fiRe this is a justifiable reaction to such a grotesque and powerful spider / bug . the one consolation that most of us in the north o the equator will ever have an issue with these scuttling into our bedrooms while we sleep . they are found only in south america , where the climate is warm enough for them to live year round and find all the rotten wood they need to survive . even though most of us will never see this beetle in real life , we can still develop a real fear of it . whether arachnophobia or just a fear of scary bugs don t spend long looking at it or you might start believing it is real
this will not stop the facebook sellers of the oil defending their product despite mounting evidence . even though essential oils have been around for so long , it is only recently that the products have become super popular commercial items thanks to marketing initiatives that target interested consumers . it is almost like people did not read the small print on these bottles and make the connection that maybe the oils are harmful to pets like cats who have much weaker constitutions . we can t blame people for being into essential oils . essential oils are usually naturally - derived and offer a potential cure for stress and other potential challenges . the current crop of companies on facebook selling essential oils are making some claims that really have no basis in fact . claims that essential oils can help you lose weight or keep your house clean are convincing a lot of people to invest in these products without realizing that it is personal drive and work ethic that will actually help them lose weight and keep a tidy house . two of the biggest companies are young living essential oils and doterra , which has recruited over 3 million sellers since it s launch on 2008 . in any event , customers are taking to facebook to offer their concerns after a mom posted about how she accidentally poisoned her cat with an essential oil spray . sue murray , who lives in michigan , posted that her daughter s cat ernie did not take well to the spray . she was using a eucalyptus spray she bought on amazon in her bedroom because she read somewhere that it helped with congestion . all it seems to have done is make 16 - year old ernie feel sick . the first couple days i didn t notice any symptoms with ernie , but on the fourth day , he was lethargic , unstable on his feet and he was drooling excessively . it was only then that her husband looked up eucalyptus and realized it can be fatal for cats . they rushed ernie to the vet and made sure he got the attention he needed . the vet gave him a shot of antibiotics and another shot of vitamins to boost him and instructions to watch him over the weekend , according to sue . she went on to add that ernie has not been himself . he is eating and drinking a little , walking a little better , has some diarrhea , but is still not out of the woods . of course , it goes without saying that sue was not informed of these risks by the company she bought from . her post has been shared over 700 , 000 times and points to a general concern amongst consumers that information is lacking in the essential oils they buy . the reaction from companies has been just as swift as the complaints brought about after sue s post . many of these companies claim their products are safe to use around pets , and that it is really a rare case for an essential oil to harmful . one of the bigger companies , doterra , even went so far as accusing sue of buying cheap oils
facebook / destinythegame promo image for " destiny 2 ' s " first dlc " curse of osiris . " " destiny 2 ' s " faction rallies was one of the major events in the game that debuted recently . however , they did not run as smoothly as bungie may have hoped . bungie was recently prompted to issue an apology to " destiny 2 " gamers after many of them noticed that they had received far less new weapons after winning in the faction rallies for season 2 . meanwhile , other players also complained of receiving redundant loot items upon redeeming their faction engrams . the game developer has since recognized these feedback from fans and explained that they had applied a new mechanism of distributing new weapons in the faction rallies for season 2 . " it was not made clear beforehand that the new season 2 weapons would be added throughout the events of the season rather than all at once in the beginning . this was on us . no excuses , " bungie explained in a community forum . in a separate statement explaining the distribution of new weapons in upcoming faction rallies , bungie confirmed that each faction would receive five new weapons which , as mentioned , would be handed out all throughout the event . bungie explained that the weapon rewards , called winner ' s offering , will be changed to a new type as a new faction rally event takes place . the auto rifle winner ' s offering for the first rally has already been made available . as for the second rally , the same rule applies and bungie added : " additionally , the previous winner ' s offering ( auto rifles ) and an additional weapon are added to faction engram rewards . " meanwhile , the game developer promised that the third and final faction rally in season 2 will also call for a new weapon " that has yet to be featured . " " the previous winner ' s offering will be added to the faction engram rewards , alongside an additional weapon . this brings the total to four weapons within the faction engram , and a final winner ' s offering for factions to compete for over the course of the event , " bungie further explained . recently , bungie was also criticized by " destiny 2 " players after they imposed a restriction in the number of chest rewards that can be claimed . the developer has since explained that this had been done to address an exploit that allowed players to harvest loots in the lost sector at a rate much faster than bungie preferred . however , bungie agreed with players that the remedy they had applied " is way too penalizing " and promised to fix it in an upcoming patch .
numsa : the south african union that confronts new forms of apartheid through class struggle the massacre of the mine workers in august of 2012 was actually the catalyst for the decision that numsa made in the following year to break away from the alliance . the dawn news spoke to phakamile hlubi of the national union of metalworkers of south africa about their struggle against the neoliberal government in south africa , worker s power and their vision of pan african socialism . phakamile hlubi : numsa represents over 350 , 000 metal workers . we are a trade union that was born from the metal working industry but we have since 2013 expanded our scope , we now represent workers along the value chain of metal working . its moved from the automotive industry to transportation to mining , and we are now even organizing the energy sector . so for example the power utility esKom has numsa members , nersa - - national energy regulator of south africa - - has numsa members . but the bottom line is that the workers we represent mostly are in the metal industry , the automotive industry , and along that value chain . what is numsa s position towards the current government and political context in south africa i ll answer your question first and then i ll give some context . our view of the current south african government is we have taken a very oppositionist perspective , we are opposed to the anc - - african national congress , ruling party in south africa - - - led government . up until 2013 numsa was an active member and an alliance partner and supporter of the anc . this was because in the days of the liberation movement when we were still fighting the apartheid regime , all of the various formations , the trade unions , the nGos and the popular community struggles which were all fighting against apartheid all came together in an alliance . so if you were an anc member you were automatically a supporter of all of the trade union federations , of cosatu - - congress of south african trade unions - - for example . you were automatically a supporter of the udf - - united democratic front . so that was the history , that was the alliance which was formed during the times of apartheid which was made up of the anc , cosatu , sacp - - south african communist party - - and other organizations were all part of one umbrella organization supporting each other in alliance . from the early 90 s , we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the anc had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies . even in 1994 when south africa transitioned from apartheid to a democratic or a so - called democratic state , that alliance continued . the anc government was in power but it was in power because of this alliance that it had and because of this relationship it had with the south african communist party and other trade unions . numsa was part of cosatu at that time , and of course we were then automatically part of the alliance , and we did endorse the anc government . however , we were opposed even though we were supporting them ; politically we did not necessarily agree with the economic strategy that they were pursuing . from the early 90 s , we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the anc had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies . we had within the alliance expressed an extreme opposition because we felt that these economic policies in the long term would have a hugely detrimental impact on the working class in south africa because they ultimately increased poverty and they would not attend to the problem of inequality which we inherited as a result of the apartheid system . apartheid in south africa in many ways remains even today . we say that because even though it is illegal for anybody to be racist towards you , in practice our economy is racist . our economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid , very little has changed . after the black government took over , even now 23 years later , the means of production , the ownership structure of most corporations , especially multinationals and big companies , they are all dominated by white capitalists and white capitalist companies . you have a situation where the richest people in south africa continue to be white people , just like it was under apartheid , white people continue to live the best lives just like they did under apartheid . that s when you realize that the battle has to be much more than just about race . if you are not dealing with the fundamentals and the fundamental structure of the economy then you re never going to change that kind of racial imbalance that we have inherited from the apartheid and colonial systems that we had in this country . our economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid , very little has changed . our government did not fundamentally transform , so they did not demand land , they did not nationalize the land , they did not nationalize the minerals , they did not offer free and compulsory education and health care and all of those things . they have pretty much followed and adhered to the demands of the world bank and ratings agencies in terms of how our economy is structured . it s allowed the dominance of white capital to continue as if apartheid did not end . even in that time we have had , for example , the implementation of labor brokering , which has had a really negative impact on workers in south africa , especially our members , many are finding themselves in precarious work , because of what labor brokering does . our government now is tolling the freeways , in a system called e - tolls that commercializes the use of the roads . it was those decisions , and ultimately marikana , the massacre of the mine workers in august of 2012 was actually the catalyst for the decision that numsa made in the following year in 2013 to break away from the alliance because it then became patently clear that the government was actually an enemy . it was not a government of the working class , it was not a government that was interested in social justice for the majority of the working class ; it was a government which had in essence become a security guard if i can say to protect white corporate and white capitalist interests . i think it s very important , i have to say that when we talk about the racism and that aspect , we are sometimes accused of being racist but we are not being racist , we are just articulating the reality . in a country where the majority of the people are african , it just doesn t make sense that the economy should be controlled by such a small percentage of people . that is ultimately what we are fighting against . thats why in 2013 , in the special national congress of numsa their members made the decision that they would no longer support the anc government in the alliance , they would no longer support president jacob zuma as president of the country especially because of the extreme levels of corruption that were emerging , and him spending millions on his own personal home , and we were now going to pursue an agenda for the working class and we were going to pursue the idea of the formation of a worker s party , whose interests champion the interests of the working class . many members of the anc are actually communists , however , in practice their policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor . when numsa made that decision , we were then expelled from cosatu , and when you are expelled from cosatu , there are a whole load of other things that happened as a result of that . so our view of the current political dispensation is that whilst they may sound like they care about the working class , and you will hear they use the right kind of language , because they do have that liberation history , and they do have a long association of working with working class formations , many members of the anc are actually communists , or members of the south african communist party . however , in practice if you look at the economic policies that have been implemented , those policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor . as we speak right now the anc government is proposing legislation to undermine all of the hard work and the rights that we have fought for as workers in south africa . during apartheid , african workers had no right to organize , they were not allowed to join a union , it was illegal to unionize , and you could be severely punished for being involved in those types of activities . now what we are finding is that they are trying to change the legislation , but its a type of oppression that is very clever . they are not oppressing you with the gun , what they have said is that from next year may , if you want to go on strike , in the middle of your strike if your strike is a very long and lengthy strike , the state has the right to approach the labor court , and stop your strike , if its having an extremely negative impact on the economy . they have also proposed that we as trade unionists must ballot , and hold elections among ourselves where we allow our members to vote and say whether they want to have a strike or not . usually in trade union culture when members want to go on strike its very simple . you have a mass meeting , workers en mass will agree with a show of hands , yes we all agree , we want to go on strike or no that s it , we are done , its over , but its a very sort of informal process but it is done very organically and its done in that style . now they want us to have an election , where we must cast votes in a secret way to say yes we want to continue with the strike or no we don t continue with the strike . by implementing a system like that you are actually in effect subverting the right to strike . the right to strike is now no longer an automatic right , it is now being hampered by bureaucracy . so they are using bureaucracy as a way to limit our right to strike . the right to strike is now no longer an automatic right , it is now being hampered by bureaucracy . how they have justified this is by marikana . they blame the marikana massacre on the workers , they believe that the violence that took place at that time was because the workers were violent . the workers were violent , therefore the police had to come out and shoot 34 unarmed striking workers . after marikana , there was a platinum strike of over 6 weeks , it was one of the longest strikes ever recorded in post - apartheid south africa . it almost destroyed the platinum industry in south africa because workers were inspired by what they had seen in marikana and they were also horrified by the mass murder , so they refused to back down on the demand for 12 , 000 rand . the demand for that wage of 12 , 000 rand was the catalyst and what sparked the marikana strike . so you found that all of these miners in and around the platinum belt all started demanding the same thing , which caused a massive strike that lasted a long time , which the state couldn t break . its for that reason that they have now come up with these laws , which they designed to try and limit our rights so that they can actually intervene and stop the strike when they feel like we are having too much of an impact . at numsa that means we are even more an enemy of the state than we were before , because as far as we are concerned this bill is an infringement on our fundamental and basic right to strike . the bill at the moment is still a bill and there are public consultations taking place so as numsa we have participated in the consultation , where we have rejected it , but we are also planning to take the issue to the constitutional court . we believe that it is a constitutional violation , that what our government is trying to achieve is actually going to remove our most basic rights , a right we did not have during apartheid and now it seems in this post - apartheid government , that right is going to be taken away by the very same progressive black government , because they are only interested in protecting the interests of capital and big business . what is numsa s perspective on how they see pan african unity happening on the continent for us , solidarity - - whether it s pan african or international - - is critical . we were part of the liberation movement in the days of apartheid and it was international solidarity that played a major role in destroying the apartheid government . as marxists and as leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent . that is why we have been actively supporting our zambian comrades with the struggles that they are facing against the lungu regime , particularly because as south africans we were hosted by the zambian government under apartheid and now that we see them , when we see them suffering we feel that it is our responsibility to highlight the crisis . in fact we were the first in south africa to raise the alarm about what was going on in zambia , because the zambian government and the south african government are very cozy , they are very good friends . the mainstream media in south africa is asleep when it comes to these issues . they are not very connected to what is going on in the continent , they are very focused on what is goes on in south africa , they are very insular . when ordinary zambians started complaining about rights abuses , a lot of people weren t even hearing them and it was only really when numsa started to make a lot of noise on behalf of zambian people that south africans started to be aware of the oppression that was taking place through the lungu government . as marxists and as leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent . we are also creating relationships with other african countries and we are doing that through the pan african today . earlier in the year we hosted the pan african socialist conference in tunisia , and even my presence here in brazil as a representative of numsa is part of that process . we believe that it is very important that we must build these relationships because we can see the attack against the working class , ultimately we are all fighting the same battles . we are fighting former liberation governments who because of the fact that they believe that they freed us from colonialism they can do as they please . anywhere on the continent you have your mugabes of zimbabwe for example , mugabe felt he had the right to be a dictator for 30 years because he liberated the people of zimbabwe from colonialists , and we are all suffering from that . when you look at what happens in that transition , what kind of government takes place after that so called liberation takes place , its oppression through a different form , its oppression through capitalism and pursuing a neoliberal agenda . in south africa , that oppression has resulted in an unemployment rate of 35 and growing , where poverty levels are at 55 and growing , 55 of the entire population is living below the poverty line . where three white men own the entire wealth of the south african economy , so we realized that it is not enough for you to fight a battle against racism , ultimately the demon here is not racism , it s a system , a capitalist system which perpetuates inequality . so that s why its very important for us to speak about solidarity and creating a media platform where we can have and express our ideology as members of the working class because we know that it is the socialist ideology which is truly the solution to the world s ills . we are hoping that the rest of the continent can also come to this realization , and this is the message that we are trying to spread all over the continent and all over the world as well . this article previously appeared in the dawn news
what western imperialism is up to now in zimbabwe the capitalist agenda is to neo - colonize zimbabwe and appropriate its labor and land . when the press and media of the so - called western world adjust their depiction of a nation they had formally demonized to one worthy of cooperation we should pause for a more critical analysis . when it comes to capitalist and white supremacist portrayals of african countries zimbabwe is no different . it is never about the details or the context and all about the optics and the propaganda . from news outlets like reuters and across the us and european press in general , the message is : mugabe out - - white farmers back in , and the poor blacks with bad teeth dance and celebrate the return of the white saviors . irrespective of the real details behind a given story , the fact that such images are broadcast around the world is a blow against africans / black people at home and abroad . the media of white supremacy is a beast . just as dangerous is the capitalist agenda at the back end maneuvering to neo - colonize zimbabwe and appropriate its labor and land . it is a mischaracterization to claim that the fast track land program kicked off the violence of the land seizures in the late 1990 s . a december 21 st article in reuters suggesting that blacks were elated by the return of white farmer rob smart actually reveals something different upon closer examination . the racist spin of the article first explains that , " land ownership is one of zimbabwe s most sensitive political topics . colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless . " then it describes the 2001 fast track land redistribution program to reclaim african land by president robert mugabe . " twenty years later , mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white - owned farms . " erased from this account is the brutal violence that accompanied europe s settler colonization in southern africa in the late 1800 s with the help of the maxim gun , as well as the horrors of the apartheid system in rhodesia . it is also a mischaracterization to claim that the fast track land program kicked off the violence of the land seizures in the late 1990 s . the truth is the program was an intervention to the violence led by african liberation war veterans who were dissatisfied with slowness in rectifying the unjust colonial allocations of land . the reuters story also implies that returning the farm to smart could signify a reversing of the entire land redistribution process by the new president of zimbabwe , emmerson mnangagwa , for the sake of the economic recovery of the country . but rob smart lost his farm just last june in what was apparently an illegal seizure that was not in compliance with the program implemented under mugabe . because the taking of this farm was so recent , and apparently did not follow an established procedure , it appears to no wider conclusions can be drawn . it s more of a special case . the country s majority population is in the rural areas that benefitted most directly from the land reform . reversing the 17 year old land reforms to hand land back to whites is highly unfeasible . that process is past the point of no return . doing so would be the easiest way to get the country to reject the new transitions in government . while the media is fond of showing images in the urban areas , particularly in the capital harare where there has been majority opposition to zanu pf and mugabe , the country s majority population is in the rural areas that benefitted most directly from the land reform . in his december 4 th inauguration speech president mnangagwa said , given our historical realities , we wish the rest of the world to understand and appreciate that policies and programs related to land reform were inevitable . whilst there is a lot we may need to do by way of outcomes , the principle of repossessing our land cannot be challenged or reversed . when imperialism s magicians perform sleights of hand its media is central to the distractions . even though african land in zimbabwe reclaimed from white settlers appears to be safe for now , the other areas where collusion with the west is acute should be of serious concern . the magician s trick to destabilize zimbabwe under the leadership of mugabe was to impose measures to ruin the economy through pervasive sanctions of the us , uK , and eu then blame the outcome on mugabe . only folly can make anyone accept that the sanctions were a response to human rights abuses or election rigging . the west not only turns a blind eye to but aids and abets the most unspeakable human rights violations in the heart of africa : uganda , rwanda , and congo . the principle of repossessing our land cannot be challenged or reversed . sanctions against close us and western ally saudi arabia would be unthinkable , a country that holds no elections at all and sentences its citizens to be stoned to death . furthermore the us has orchestrated the overthrow of a virtually endless list of democratically elected governments from africa , asia to latin america . us hands are currently drenched in the blood of africans in libya . their goal in zimbabwe has been the consistent one for imperialism . the strategies change to adapt to the varied conditions , historical and otherwise , of a particular country . about nine years after zimbabwe s 1980 independence , the country - - like many others following the collapse of the soviet union - - was forced into accepting loans from the international monetary fund and the world bank . the loans , notorious for having strings attached in the form of esaps ( economic structural adjustment programs ) that mandate various privatization and deregulation measures , had gravely adverse impacts on zimbabweans like they do in any country . the us has orchestrated the overthrow of a virtually endless list of democratically elected governments from africa , asia to latin america . so it was in the subsequent political standoff between zanu - pf and imperialism beginning in the late 1990 s and led by president robert mugabe that three key things happened : 1 . ) zimbabwe initiated its fast track land reform , 2 . ) it enacted a law for indigenous african control of foreign companies , including mines , and 3 . ) done nowhere else in africa , it jettisoned the esaps to re - embark on a more socialist path , as it had started with after independence . needless to say , imperialism was not happy . amid all of this were all manner of regime change methods that included a media propaganda campaign of misinformation , half - truths , and outright lies to demonize zimbabwe and an aging robert mugabe . fast forward to today , following the removal of robert mugabe from power last november , less attention should be paid to the status of the land reform and more to the rebirth of the esap under the new president emmerson mnangagwa . and unsurprisingly the west has toned down , if not completely backed off of its condemning rhetoric . if the new leadership of zimbabwe is maintaining the anti - imperialist disposition it had under the leadership of mugabe , then they are also strangely allowing western press to tell what would be blatant lies to the contrary , reporting that : " since his appointment , mnangagwa has promised to rebuild relations with the west , to protect foreign investors and to hold elections . " less attention should be paid to the status of the land reform and more to the rebirth of the esap under the new president emmerson mnangagwa . in and of itself a coup does not necessarily indicate that the action is against the people s interest , whether the nature of the incoming government is revolutionary or neo - colonialist . thomas sankara , the upright man and revolutionary leader of burkina faso , came to power through a coup . hugo chavez s first attempt to power in venezuela was via coup . the case of the arab pan - africanist of the libyan jamahiriya , muammar gaddafi was the same . as far as imperialism is concerned , however , coups are perceived as negative and referring to the power change in zimbabwe as a coup would be problematic if it s your guy coming in . and the u . s . certainly seems to believe or want mnangagwa to be their guy , given " u . s . ambassador harry thomas avoided the term coup to describe mugabe s overthrow , referring to it as a military intervention . thomas said mnangagwa s administration should be judged by its performance - - most notably whether it manages to hold credible elections next year . " par for the course is that it really matters very little to imperialism whether or not elections set to be held in or before september 2018 are credible , as long as what now seems to be unfolding continues . high level military officials are being appointed to high level civil servant roles in the government and in at least one case holding dual roles . this is the case with former head of the armed forces constantino chiwenga who was named vice president on december 23 rd and appointed defense minister on december 29 th , retaining control of the military . the u . s . certainly seems to believe or want mnangagwa to be their guy , given that u . s . ambassador harry thomas avoided the term coup to describe mugabe s overthrow , referring to it as a military intervention . over the last month zimbabweans have seen moves to resurrect esaps like the privatizing of parastatals , the semiprivate / semipublic agencies which are meant to provide public goods like in energy , transport , communications , and agricultural sectors . privatization of this nature is always the application of a neo - liberal rationale that judges the performance of such institutions on an economic basis . do they turn a profit or do they operate in the black a revolutionary or socialist rationale would put the public good or need that the institution serves first and if there is a financial burden , consider an alternative that is not privatization . in response to questions about the january 1 st dissolving of the state procurement board ( spb ) and the establishing of the new procurement regulatory authority of zimbabwe , permanent secretary in the office of president and cabinet , ambassador boniface chidyausiku said : there will be a new set up , which is in line with best practices world over . the decision to procure now rests with the accounting officer whereas in the old system , they used to send documents to spb for approval . we came up with the new system following consultations with the world bank and the african development bank . the sad truth is that the history and complexity of what happened and is now unfolding in zimbabwe is not known nor understood by most people . western media allow only very simplified and misleading accounts . instead of feeling compelled to repay the west unjust debts , underdeveloped countries in africa and around the world should remember that the wealth amassed by international financial institution like the world bank and imf came from the plunder and rape of their lands and forced use of their labor . netfa freeman is an analyst and events coordinator for the institute for policy studies ( ips ) , a longtime organizer in the pan - african and international human rights movement , and former liaison for the ujamma youth farming project in gweru , zimbabwe . he also hosts and produces the radio show voices with vision on wpfw 89 . 3 fm .
has anyone ever been on the side of the people of congo ann garrison speaks to jean - claude maswana the democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) is the heart of black africa . millions of congolese have been murdered , massacred , enslaved , robbed of their resources , and driven from their homes since the berlin conference gave the " congo free state " to belgium ' s king leopold ii as his personal property in 1885 . patrice lumumba , the democratic republic of the congo ' s independence hero and first prime minister , famously wrote to his wife pauline from captivity in 1960 , shortly before his assassination : " we are not alone . africa , asia , and the free and liberated peoples in every corner of the globe will ever remain at the side of the millions of congolese who will not abandon the struggle until the day when there will be no more colonizers and no more of their mercenaries in our country . " but is anyone on the side of the congolese now i spoke to jean - claude maswana about the latest waves of aggression under current congolese president joseph kabila . maswana is a congolese native and economics professor at tsukuba university , japan . ann garrison : professor maswana , the congolese never seem to get a break . on the 7 th of december , tanzanian peacekeepers who were actually trying to keep the peace in congo s b ni territory were attacked . fifteen were killed , more than 50 wounded . then on christmas eve , the ugandan army started shelling b ni territory from across the border and ugandan attack aircraft crossed into congolese air space and started dropping bombs . is anyone on the side of the congolese now jean - claude maswana : the answer is no . the congolese people have never had anyone on their side . time to time , there have been some international organizations or ngos pretending to be on the congolese people s side but their support never lasts long . in the last 20 years , since rwanda and uganda invaded the congo , there have been no international institutions consistently on the congolese people s side . again , my answer will be a clear no . ag : not even the catholic church isn t it the second most powerful institution in congo , where more than half the population are catholic jcm : not even the catholic church even though it is congo s second most powerful institution and its most powerful non - state institution . in december 2016 when the catholic church played a key role in the so - called december 31 st agreement between kabila and the opposition , i didn t feel the catholic church was on the side of the people . if they were , they wouldn t have facilitated an agreement that was clearly against the country s constitution and the people s interests . ag : ok , let s step back and explain that . kabila s term was to have expired in december 2016 , but he didn t organize an election and he didn t step down . civil unrest broke out , and eventually this agreement mediated by the church was signed . what did that agreement say jcm : the agreement said that kabila could stay in power so long as he organized the elections in december 2017 . but back in december 2016 it was obvious that allowing kabila to stay beyond his constitutional term limits was a huge mistake . there was abundant evidence that he would never hold those elections in december 2017 . those of us who opposed the agreement thought that was obvious , but the catholic church didn t agree . ag : but then the catholic church did lead this march on new year s eve , right jcm : that could be seen as siding with the congolese people . nevertheless , to be honest , i don t personally think the church was really siding with the people as it should have then . i don t want to be seen as too critical of the church as they have made some efforts , and some of them were beaten by soldiers on the front lines of the new year s eve march , but the objective of that march was unclear . the church should have taken a clear stance and refused to accept anything but kabila s departure from power . no more compromise should have been made after he once again failed to organize elections . the objective of the march was to pressure kabila to implement the december 31 st [ 31 , ] 2016 agreement , but he had already failed to do that . ag : the congolese army , the president s republican guard , and the military police are heavily armed against the unarmed population , so what could the catholic church possibly do but organize a nonviolent march jcm : a peaceful march doesn t change the situation on the ground . it doesn t change the balance of political or military power . the catholic church could bring about such a change if it stopped recognizing kabila s illegal and unconstitutional presidency as legitimate . this would change the political balance of power and hopefully lead the way to the negotiated creation of a transitional government until free and fair elections could be organized in a reasonable time frame . unfortunately , the church isn t even close to refusing to recognize kabila s legitimacy . so it s leaving the political balance of power untouched and kabila is happy with this outcome . ag : that s very interesting because you re saying that another kind of nonviolent protest that is possible . jcm : yes , there are other forms of nonviolent protests that are not being implemented by the opposition or the church . ag : ok , at this point , it looks like the european union , the us , all the nato powers , and china are happy with the chaos and the mayhem . they re not disturbed enough to do anything about it . russia doesn t seem to be very involved . and the un security council has never been willing to acknowledge rwanda or uganda s presence in the congo , which is a violation of national sovereignty that the un charter would oblige them to stop if they did . so it s really up to the congolese people , right there are no other significant players on the global chessboard who are willing to intervene on their behalf . jcm : yes , that s an accurate description of the situation as i see it . the congolese people are alone in their struggle against kabila . russia , china , all the other powerful international players , support kabila because they do have ongoing deals . there is an unspoken consensus of the powerful players for leaving the situation on the ground as it is . it s unfortunate but that s the sad fact . ag : so everyone s getting the resources that they want , and the congolese people continue to be murdered and massacred without any real intervention on their behalf . monusco , the un peacekeeping operation , just seems to manage the conflict at a cost of more than 1 billion annually , most of which is paid by the west . on december 7 , well - armed troops wearing congolese uniforms actually attacked tanzanian peacekeepers who were taking their mission seriously trying to protect the population and stop the aggressors in b ni territory in a clear warning that real peacekeepers would not be tolerated . jcm : exactly . my reading is that the very same interests behind the killing of two un experts earlier this year were behind the attacks on the tanzanian peacekeepers . these attacks on un experts and peacekeepers and kabila s unconstitutional grip on power are both part of the same movie by the same producer . the un security council issues toothless , knee - jerk calls for justice and democracy in response to these crimes and nothing is done . us ambassador to the un nikki halley went to see kabila and told him he s obliged to organize elections in december 2018 same time next year . ag : since you ve told me several times now that there are no great powers willing to intervene on behalf of the congolese , i looked back at the moment in congo s history when king leopold s enforcers were committing unspeakable atrocities to extract rubber and whatever other resources from the congo free state , which the berlin conference had given to him as his personal property in 1885 . there was so much international outrage that belgium finally took over , creating the belgian congo . that was no triumph over colonialism , but there was so much outrage about king leopold s brutality that the international community of the time finally reacted . is anything like that conceivable now jcm : i don t think so because the context is very different . leopold ii was more powerful than those who gave him the ownership of the congo free state . unlike king leopold the owner , kabila has been given an assignment . international interests have decided to outsource congolese resource extraction to him , and he is in turn allowed to grab his own share of the nation s wealth . kabila acts as the head of the local affiliate in a much larger multinational enterprise . so far as its executives are concerned , he and monusco are both doing a great job , fulfilling their de facto mandate . never mind what they say out loud in the un security council , on un web tV , or through un news . this multinational enterprise has consistently been at kabila s side ever since he took power on january 17 , 2001 , the day after his adoptive father s assassination . ag : so , basically , leopold really did own and control the congo free state as an individual , as a king , but kabila s just an apparatchik . jcm : yes , exactly . ag : ok , so any real outrage would have to go beyond the apparatchik to the multinational enterprise , and that s unlikely . jcm : yes , exactly . ag : early on you explained that the only real agency on behalf of the congolese people is in the hands of the congolese people , who would themselves have to stop recognizing kabila as the rightful president . is there anything that those of us in other parts of the world who are horrified by what continues to go on there can do to support them , even if we re far from the centers of power . jcm : first , just continue to do what you ve been doing : spreading information and raising the awareness of us citizens . the end goal could be to make the drc tragedy an issue at some electoral level . next , join and support the networks of those fighting the killing machine in drc . also , bring some international and different perspectives to the conflict to help us , the drc people , expand our understanding of the tragedy . most of the time , the most vulnerable and victimized in the drc tragedy have a limited or incorrect understanding of who is really behind it , especially of who is behind it from outside the drc . ag : the information question reminded me of something . just before the peaceful march on new year s eve , kabila had the internet and sms messaging switched off . has that been restored jcm : yes , the sms and internet is back , but even so , the control is in place . the monitoring system is in place ; they have the technology , provided by some companies that i m not going to name here . they have the technology in place and they re monitoring everything and , from time to time , randomly checking people s smart phones or other devices , or forcing people to open up their facebook or whatsapp accounts , for example . ag : high tech surveillance in a nation where less than 10 of the population have electricity at home but as many as 23 may own cell phones . jcm : yes . ag : to be continued jcm : indeed .
apparently , president trump wondered why as well , and yesterday he decided to cut all military aid ( 255 million per year ) to pakistan , the country that hid osama bin laden for years after 9 / 11 . the monetary aid was denied to the pakistan government in response to its ineffective action against terrorists and militants on its soil . the hindustan times the trump administration on friday announced the united states will deny pakistan military aid amounting to 255 million as it expects islamabad to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil . the president has made clear that the united states expects pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil , and that pakistan s actions in support of the south asia strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship , including future security assistance . the administration continues to review pakistan s level of cooperation . the statement reflected and sealed the administration s complete disillusionment with pakistan , which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by president donald trump personally and leading members of his cabinet , such as secretaries james mattis and rex tillerson . this could be the severest blow dealt to islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it , said a leading us expert on pakistan , who did not want to be identified . there is more coming , the expert added .

the united states administration froze a 125 million grant to the united nations relief and works agency ( unrwa ) , the un s agency for palestinian refugees , which was supposed to be delivered on january 1 , 2018 , channel 10 news reported on friday , citing three western diplomats . inn palestinians condemned as blackmail on wednesday u . s . president donald trump s threat to withhold future aid payments over what he called the palestinians unwillingness to talk peace with israel . trump said the us pays the palestinians hundrEd Of miLLiOns Of dOLLars a year and get no appreciation or respect . they don t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with israel with the palestinians no longer willing to talk peace , why should we make any of these massive future payments to them the amount frozen is one - third of the annual funding the united states provides the organization , according to the report . the us is unrwa s single largest donor it donated 368 million to the agency in 2016 alone and a withdrawal of us support could deal a significant blow to its operations . the three diplomats , who asked to remain anonymous because of the political sensitivity of the issue , told channel 10 the grant had been frozen until the end of the reexamination of u . s . aid to the palestinians , which began in recent days . according to the diplomats , officials in the administration have informed un officials in the past two days that president donald trump is considering cutting this amount completely and could even increase the cut to 180 million , which would be half the total u . s . funding for unrwa . the cutting in the un funding to unrwa is a u . s . sanction against the organization , which has come under strong criticized from both the united states and israel , as well as against the palestinian arabs , in an attempt to pressure them to renew peace talks with israel . news of the freezing of the grant came as a meeting took place in the white house discussing the cutting of aid to the palestinian authority and to unrwa . the meeting followed trump s tweets earlier this week in which he expressed doubt over the usefulness of american aid to the palestinians , given their refusal to resume peace talks with israel . the united states is the largest single donor to unrwa , providing approximately a fourth of the organization s budget . for years , unrwa has been a target for criticism in light of hamas s activity in its educational institutions and the use of its facilities by palestinian arab terrorist organizations in gaza . unrwa was documented storing hamas rockets and weapons designed to kill israeli citizens in its schools , a fact which the unrwa chief admitted himself . in addition , the organization has actively taken part in inciting anti - semitic violence there are 56 muslim countries , many of them super wealthy , oil - rich arab gulf states , that can more than make up for what america no longer contributes .

why we must protect the world from the united states for oppressed nations and peoples of the world , the u . s . white supremacist , colonial / capitalist patriarchy is and remains the principle contradiction . fifty years ago , dr . martin luther king jr . stated the obvious : the united states was the greatest purveyor of violence in the world . he also said the public allowing this violence would lead to a kind of national spiritual death that would continue to make the u . s . state a danger to the world . that spiritual death has not quite happened completely . yet accepting the inevitability of violence and the necessity for waging war is now more deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of individuals in the united states than it was 50 years ago when king warned of the deep malady of u . s . society . for most of the 21 st century , the united states has been at war . culturally , mass shootings , the wars on drugs and terror , violence and war as entertainment , livestreamed videos of horrendous police - executed murders as well as of a head of state being sodomized with a knife have resulted in what henry giroux refers to as a culture of cruelty . but the very fact that the authorities need to lie to the people with fairy tales of the responsibility to protect in order to give moral coverage for the waging of war is an acknowledgement that they understand that there is enough humanity left with the public that it would reject u . s . warmongering if it was only seen as advancing narrow national interests . it is this remaining moral core and the objective interests of the clear majority of the people to be in opposition to war that provides the foundation for reviving the modern anti - war movement . the authorities need to lie to the people with fairy tales of the responsibility to protect in order to give moral coverage for the waging of war . baltimore was the site of the rebellion in response to freddie gray s murder by the domestic military we refer to as the police . there , a couple of hundred activists convened january 12 to kick off a new campaign to close all u . s . foreign bases . this gathering is the result of a new coalition of forces both old and new to revive the u . s . anti - war movement . this conference comes on the heels of another meeting that took place just a few months ago in washington , d . c . , where some of the same forces came together to kick - off a campaign to divest from the war machine . strategically these efforts are designed to be the first steps toward building the confidence , institutional strength and programmatic focus of a new , reinvigorated , broad - based , anti - war , pro - peace and anti - imperialist movement in the united states . we are opposing the warmongering both corporate political parties have normalized . the difficulties and challenges of this endeavor are not lost on the various organizations , networks and coalitions that are part of these efforts . we all recognize that there are no shortcuts to the delicate reconstructing of our existing forces and the challenge of expanding those forces by bringing in new formations . the ideological and political differences that have surfaced among left and progressive forces around issues of war and imperialism make it more challenging . our common interests with other oppressed peoples , nations and states that find themselves in the cross - hairs of u . s . imperialism demands we stand as allies . but the imperative of expressing solidarity with the victims of u . s . warmongering must take precedence over our differences and should serve as a basis for building political unity . solidarity , however , is not enough for those of us in the black alliance for peace ( bap ) . we recognize its importance as a baseline principle for ( re ) - building a broad anti - war movement . our common interests with other oppressed peoples , nations and states that find themselves in the cross - hairs of u . s . imperialism demands we offer more than solidarity we must stand as allies . those of us building the black alliance for peace understand we cannot afford the comforting myths of u . s . benevolence that attempts to conceal the naked deployment of u . s . state power in service of western capitalist / colonialist interests . and so , we view with suspicion , if not treat with disdain , our comrades who support u . s . interventions , even when they frame that support with leftist justifications . for oppressed nations and peoples of the world , the u . s . white supremacist , colonial / capitalist patriarchy is and remains the principle contradiction . there must not be any nationalist sentimentality or equivocation on that position . we saw how the anti - war opposition that emerged during the bush years in opposition to lawless state - sanctioned violence , dissolved during the obama administration . liberals and major elements of the left objectively aligned themselves with the u . s . / eu / Nato axis of domination through their silence or outright support in the name of opposing authoritarian regimes . liberals and major elements of the left objectively aligned themselves with the u . s . / eu / Nato axis of domination through their silence or outright support in the name of opposing authoritarian regimes . the consequence of that class collaboration is the spectrum of war has today become a permanent feature of policy discourse . the obscene 80 billion increase in military spending that was supported by both parties and the corporate media reflects that collaboration and the corrosive impact of almost two decades of militarism on the politics and consciousness of the public . so , for bap , the historic task is clear . the people must be separated from the capitalist oligarchy and the nature of the state must be exposed . our politics must be clear and our rhetoric devoid of liberal ambiguities . we must expose the underlying capitalist - class interests that are masked by appeals to national interests and patriotism . the anti - war movement must advance a clear understanding of the economic and class interests that are at root of imperialist strategies and great power conflicts . we must assert without equivocation the position that we can t get rid of the scourge of war without getting rid of racism and capitalism and that the people should reject all calls to protect the national interests promoted by the ruling elites . we must say if the rulers want war , let them fight it themselves we can t get rid of the scourge of war without getting rid of racism and capitalism . the anti - war and anti - imperialist position must be seen as the highest expression of internationalism and global solidarity . activists in the united states must reject all efforts to pink - wash militarism and recognize their moral obligation as citizens of empire to oppose all u . s . military interventions . we must take the position that we will no longer allow chicken hawk politicians to send our sons and daughters off to other lands , where they become war criminals fighting other working - class and poor people who only want social justice , national sovereignty and self - determination for themselves . the permanent war agenda of the capitalist dictatorship must be met with permanent opposition from the working class and all oppressed people . the people must understand the link between the racialized justifications for making war abroad with the intensification of the war being waged against black and brown communities in the united states . we say to progressives that you can t pretend that you believe black lives matter in the united states and not be opposed to the assault on the humanity of palestinians , of yemenis , of the millions lost in the democratic republic of the congo , of the destruction of libya and of coups in honduras and destabilization in venezuela . reject the racist 21 st century version of the white man s burden with its absurd notion of humanitarian war and the responsibility to protect and understand that the real threat to world peace is the empire that we are all a part of . our task is clear : the anti - war position is not an add - on . it is a fundamental moral and political obligation for the citizens of empire . the world can no longer wait . ajamu baraka is the national organizer of the black alliance for peace and was the 2016 candidate for vice president on the green party ticket . he is an editor and contributing columnist for the black agenda report and contributing columnist for counterpunch . his latest publications include contributions to jackson rising : the struggle for economic democracy and self -

money laundering , real estate scams , grade fixing and more at a little rock hbcu the following is an investigative report by a long - time member of the black community in little rock who has close knowledge of the history and corruption of arkansas baptist college . this is a story of money laundering , sweet heart land deals , grade fixing , and fraud that includes not just some despicable small - time negroes acting like minstrels but african american and other clinton appointees that reach to the highest levels of big business in little rock ( oil , biotech , finance , department stores ) who have tried to use the abc foundation as a veil for their economic ambition as actual education is betrayed . moon ah run till day ketch am . an african proverb a college president throws all the books out of the library and replaces them with video games . an undergraduate is permitted to be the assistant registrar , and there is a grade fixing scandal . the executive of the dining hall orders too much food and always runs out of food ; it is known she has a catering business on the side . with no endowment , and living on an austerity budget where the light and telephone bills cannot be paid , a college gets exorbitant loans to purchase land and erect buildings . the buildings are not finally paid for , but construction is done with multiple businesses affiliated with campus administrators . land worth far less than it was paid for is purchased from members of the board of trustees . the college president who is fired is not the one who led the scandalous regime but the one trying to discover and clean up the mess . this is the perennial scandal at rkansas baptist college . in the last five years we have heard about conflicts between college presidents and boards of trustees at historically black colleges and universities ( hbcus ) : famu , alabama state , south carolina state , morgan state , delaware state , morehouse , and wilberforce . what spills out into the public is a difficult environment for professional administrators to do what is normatively termed their job because of the authoritarian behavior and overreach of board of trustees ( bots ) at hbcus . however , in most cases , the actual policy disputes or signs of violations of morality in public affairs never surface from these controversies . we have not been able to understand what is happening at our hbcus , because the elite that runs them , even when they quarrel among themselves , believe they cannot trust ordinary black people , the teachers , campus workers , students , and neighbors , to organize themselves and lead their own community institutions . they do not open the books , the accounting or financial records , for public discussion so we can discern the truth for ourselves about austerity crises . many of us believe it is a tragedy though when our professionals who mean well cannot assist in cultivating the popular will toward a greater self - reliance . perhaps we need to move on toward a disposition that the professional classes , as a whole , need to be abolished as the embodiment of culture and governance in our community . recently , the administration of dr . joseph l . jones resigned or was fired at arkansas baptist college ( abc ) . jones held his position for a little more than a year . the board of trustees ( bot ) submits jones was terminated for lack of transparency and loss of confidence in his leadership . yet , a recent visit by the college s accrediting body , the higher learning commission ( hlc ) , suggests by most professional standards , jones s administration was performing satisfactorily . they were pleased by its honesty and accountability under the adversity of having to govern the school under an austerity budget and heightened cash monitoring in contrast to the previous administration led by dr . fitz hill . a petition on change . org signed by horrace zulu maddox , a little rock community member , and over 40 others , calls for the removal of dr . fitz hill , the college president preceding dr . jones , from the arkansas state board of education . signing this petition could be a crucial aspect of turning the tide in little rock . dr . hill was appointed by governor asa hutchinson to observe the financial and educational standards of schools . maddox made clear that despite hearsay in the community about dr . hill s desire to run for mayor of little rock in the future , dr . hill was not a success as leader of abc , as his cohorts in the church and business community claim . hill s so - called kingdom transformation dr . fitz hill was the president of abc from 2006 to 2016 . in recent times , the average president of an hbcu across the country is permitted to stay on for one to three years . one statistic suggests in the last five years , a black college president is fired every 23 days , often by an overwhelmingly black board of trustees . are black college administrators an oppressed class of people probably not . but they are submitted to abuse far beyond the standard professionals in their position know at other institutions . how could dr . hill , a college president the last ten years , who was thereafter appointed to lead the arkansas baptist college foundation , and recently added as a member of an emergency management committee of the bot , be permitted to oversee jones s administration if he in fact bankrupted the college and replaced the library s books with video games under dr . hill s leadership , he disregarded historical archives and threw all the books out of the college library , though some were damaged , and replaced them with video games . he permitted an assistant registrar to be an undergraduate who fixed and falsified grades . dr . hill also bankrupted the college by taking exorbitant loans , including a 30 million hbcu debt consolidation loan . it is a federal felony to attain these loans by falsifying information . given the lack of financial viability of the institution , what lengths did hill go to attain the loan , and what was the interest of the lenders given abc had no endowment or assets this gives us some indication of hill s wisdom as an educator and the bot s capacity to ethically oversee education for black people . the bot , presently led by dr . kenneth harris and bill walker , widely known in little rock for financial impropriety as a former public servant , have put it out in public that dr . jones s administration was terminated when it was revealed they did not pay withholding taxes for a few months . if this is true , research shows that for a far longer period dr . hill s administration in the past did not pay these same taxes , and harris was on the abc bot then as well . further , the bot acknowledges that dr . hill currently presides over an abc non - profit foundation that does not have a 501 c3 status , as the maddox petition highlighted . dr . harris erroneously explains there has been a delay in registering their foundation because of a shifting approach of the bot to the engagement of new market tax credits . while a change in focus of said foundation may be the case , that does not prevent foundation officials from filing the appropriate paperwork to keep the federal non - profit status current . we need to understand what is behind the bot s concern with new market tax credits and not properly registering the college s fundraising arm . apparently , the bot enables excessive financial and other mismanagement of some people while quarreling with others whose mistakes are minimal in comparison . the lapsing of abc non - profit foundation 501 c3 status dates back to 2013 , three years before dr . hill steps down as the president . and the suspected creation of a new shadowy foundation points to a trail of abuses that lead to criminal ties with big business in little rock . evidence suggests that another non - profit foundation was being created by dr . hill and his friends as early as 2015 . the terms of dr . jones s employment beginning in 2016 included that dr . hill would assume the role of president of the abc foundation and be primarily responsible for fundraising to pay back the 30 million debt consolidation loan taken out by hill in 2014 . yet as of december 2017 , dr . harris , the chairman of the bot , acknowledges that the college foundation has no legal status as mentioned previously , though harris has been part of bot meetings where it has been noted that the foundation exists - with prominent members on its board - and this group was approved by the college bot in the last meeting before dr . jones was hired . big donors and divine dollars hill s president s decade report , kingdom transformation : a decade of service and divine moments in the midst of challenges , lists the following big donors : first security bank new market tax credits ( john rutledge ) scott ford bear state foundation massey family charitable foundation , inc ( rick massey ) coulson foundation ( mike and beth coulson ) stephen s inc . ( warren stephens ) griffith group llc / baton rouge foundation ( barry and andrea griffith ) carl and witt stephens charitable foundation win rockefeller foundation dillards inc . ( william dillard inc . ) these big names in department stores , biotech , oil , and finance leave out various smaller divine dollar donations from baptist church affiliated groups and individual citizens . dr . harris , in a recent public statement , explains that there has been a transition in how the bot sees the uses of a non - profit foundation . harris acknowledges that abc previously conceived of their foundation as facilitating new market tax credits . new market tax credits and empowerment zones experienced observers understand these tax credits are consistent with what used to be called empowerment zones . such were never meant to be empowering to the black working class and unemployed . but hustlers such as hill , whose brand , was the aspiration to put the neighbor back in the hood latched onto them . hill grew up as jim crow was coming to a close . but rather than dream of fighting the klan and police , he chose instead to identify with the grocery store owner , with the captive market under segregation , as the embodiment of black autonomy and unity in the community . hill speaks in a way that romaticizes jim crow , of the need to promote black business , corporate reinvestment , and overcoming government neglect around the historic community that houses abc and philander smith college , another small hbcu a few blocks down the way . either people like hill are very smart or very stupid . corner grocery store owners are not multi - national corporations , big businesses are not black businesses . government intervention in our communities to promote capital accumulation is not black people forming their own government or finding their self - reliance . hill and the bot represent a backward traditional notion which holds that black individual private accumulation of wealth is somehow a cooperative project . the promotion of new market tax credits or empowerment zones creates incentives for private capital to invest in decaying low income neighborhoods so they might reinvigorate their business districts and raise real estate values . this paves the way for the state , major capitalists , and negroes of the uncle ruckus variety to collude and cash in . the african bean company and other mysterious entities in february 2014 , hill s administration responded to the hlc ( and their hired special investigators egp led by jo spencer ) who were seeking missing financial records from 2010 - 2015 . multiple anonymous complaints to the hlc flagged that monies collected by the abc foundation did not go toward the college s development . a cluster of overlapping companies was investigated that had some relationship with the abc foundation before 2013 when its paperwork began not to be kept up . these included : buffalo development llc , turner development llc ( robert turner ) , african bean company ( dr . hill s company with the same initials as arkansas baptist college good for depositing checks written to abc ) , billy jones consulting . egp was not able to get appropriate records for these overlapping companies , payroll records , and employee job descriptions . abc s college mascot is the buffalo . dr . hill in no way identifies as an african in any honorable way . under these organizational premises while arkansas baptist college could not pay its light bills , dr . hill and associates took out loans to build two modest buildings ( one never fully paid for ) and purchase large empty lots around the college . most prominently hill purchased an antiquated hand carwash and prominently displayed the college s name on that lot he has bragged this was a contribution to fighting crime and drugs it is notable that a prominent african american , judge wendell griffin , who is critical of police brutality , supports the idea of black lives matter , and whom used to be on the abc bot , moved that hill be fired for criminal activities . the judge was outvoted and resigned in disgust . what did dr . jones s administration step into dr . jones , it was hoped by the bot , as a young first - time college president , would be inexperienced enough to not understand , enable , or be made the scapegoat for the long trail of abuses hill and the bot created before his arrival . this is not to suggest dr . jones did all he could to draw the line as an anti - corruption president , in the public arena , between his administration and the previous hill regime . he actually adhered too much to normative professionalism and protocols , and this led to his demise . a reconsideration of how professional we wish our hbcus to be is necessary , as many undoubtedly wish to take pride in them . dr . jones , early in his administration , found many operational peculiarities that he tried to fix . he uncovered a grade fixing scandal with an undergraduate student as the assistant registrar . football coaches collected ticket and concession revenues and took them to their homes as opposed to the chief financial officer and / or business office representative immediately following the game . overspending and inventory irregularities persisted by the executive director of the dining hall , who is known to have her own catering business , and campus security issues remained prevalent on the campus , including repeated gun and domestic violence incidences . dr . jones came into conflict with the bot regarding the mission of the school . accusing dr . jones of changing the abc mission , what the bot really meant was hill and the bot actually re - branded the college as a place for low - performing , low - income pariahs to come and be rehabilitated i . e . a half - way of sorts for sub - standard football players . the bot repeatedly attested that young black men could not attain a standard liberal arts education . they dishonestly equated cultural criticism of standardized tests with the idea that young black men cannot achieve or learn by any measure recognizable by black history . furthermore , hill and the bot were never serious about developing reading , writing , research , and public speaking . they assumed the descendants of slaves , found at hbcus , could never express themselves vibrantly . how did richard wright , zora neale hurston , ida b wells , ralph ellison , paul robeson , toni morrison , james baldwin , langston hughes , and alice walker figure this out dr . hill left dr . jones with a student body that he recruited in detroit and chicago by essentially welcoming all to get on the bus . the previous administration , who struggled to process financial aid forms themselves , accumulated many students who had minimal basic skills . dr . jones , who grew up in los angeles , welcomed students who might not be prepared for college as he initially was not . but he insisted when students come to college , they need not only see themselves but be exposed to peoples and cultures that are new to them . hbcus needed to provide a sense of wonder and possibility . dr . jones also tried to internationalize the education at abc . he affiliated the college with the american council on education and created an international studies awareness week . he was struggling to attract faculty rooted in traditions which have deep awareness of african and caribbean history and that questioned empire . reportedly , some students experienced some innovative programs that allowed them to discuss comparative religion , migrant workers , the haitian revolution , the music of trinidad and jamaica , nkrumah s ghana , selassie s ethiopia , and the experience of blacks in montreal , canada . students were also encouraged , for the first time in years , to study abroad and consider studying foreign languages . there was also talk about getting involved in caribbean disaster relief , which reinvigorated abc s few international students , and the promise of recruiting more to the campus . dr . jones was not fired because he threatened a system of hustles in the dining hall , tried to rein in the patronage schemes of abc s losing football program , ended grade fixing or put books back in the library and tried to get black students to study abroad and care about the african world . dr . jones s real crime , was his that administration s accounting practices were so transparent , despite having to afro - engineer bills left by hill , that the masterminds behind hill feared he would uncover how arkansas baptist college was seemingly being used by arkansas politicians , big business , and financial elites even as they made donations that the college rarely benefited . if such a cast of prosperous characters could have paid all the college s debts and started a proper endowment , and they cared so much about black education , why did they not do so the shadowy foundation that does not exist arkansas baptist college , under the bot and hill has perhaps more value as a pawn for money laundering and sweet heart real estate deals , than it has as one with informed students , dynamic teachers , and ethical administrators who don t seek to enrich themselves . the shadowy non - profit college foundation , with a now 4 - year long lapsed 501 ( c ) 3 status , could be central to uncovering the greatest scandals of them all . dr . fitz hill assumed the presidency of the college s foundation at the same time of dr . jones s appointment as the president of the college , september 1 , 2016 . some who most likely helped hill organize this opaque entity before hill left his post as the college president , were former abc board chair beth coulson of coulson oil , who was also a judge appointed by bill clinton ( whose foundation is currently under scrutiny ) , and former bot member bob childress , a prominent cpa in little rock , also a clinton appointee . anonymous sources relay that coulson and childress were in conversation with other figures in the foundation machination . regina favors , a former blue cross blue shield executive and clinton appointee and a former chair of the abc bot , barry griffith , and bill dilliard iii were part of this dialogue . whit penick , senior Vp of first security bank , the college s primary capital projects and short term lender , like favors and griffith , was approved by the abc bot to be on the foundation board shrouded in mystery . given their professional track record and expertise , and the board members fiduciary responsibility , how is it that hill was allowed to head an entity that not only failed to maintain its tax exempt status , but it is still revoked currently does the college foundation that has a public track record , albeit operationally flawed , act as a front organization for another how could donors give to a foundation with no tax - free status and receive their write - off are they in fact giving to another unknown entity were hill and board members reaping personal benefits in some way the obscuring of sources of money , either intentionally or by not tracking sources or destinations properly happened at the height of dr . hill s regime , where obviously the lack of 501 ( c ) 3 status implicates not only hill and the foundation board , but also donors to the foundation and the college s bot since the foundation board reports to the college bot . also noteworthy is most anti - money laundering laws are concerned with the source of funds and the ethics of what is being financed or the destination of funds . dr . hill made many land purchases in the name of the college from 2006 - 2016 , most of which , as public records confirm , had no value corresponding to what he paid for them . all of these deals were done while the college consistently could not pay its light and phone bills . under hill , abc made land deals with the massey family which is also his primary benefactor and is thought to be a major spirit animating the invisible foundation . richard n . massey is the former college bot treasurer . another land transaction , with right development llc , is the company of attorney richard l mays , a longtime member of abc s bot , who was appointed by bill clinton to the arkansas supreme court and has served on the arkansas ethics commission . one of the largest land purchases under hill s tenure was from abraham carpenter sr . , an african american produce supplier to wal - mart and kroger . a five - year loan was floated by summit bank . drew harper , at the time executive vice president of summit , was on abc s bot . considered unethical because it is not in the best interest of the larger community of stakeholders , a sweet heart deal is one where one party in a business transaction is presented with very attractive terms and conditions . whether we read these land purchases under hill as sweet or not , clear conflicts of interest exist between board members and the college s president . whomever accumulates wealth from such transactions , and knows that the college cannot pay its bills except by acquiring more debt , is acting unethically . during the jones administration the bot insisted that all purchases over 5 , 000 would have to be approved by them . the bot is required to keep publicly accessible minutes for all their meetings by law . where is the documentation of the bot s approval of numerous land purchases at values of 10 , 000 to 285 , 000 under dr . hill from 2006 - 2016 it has not been in the interest of the arkansas baptist college community to bankrupt the school through exorbitant loans supposedly to pay its debts . in reality these loans have been used to accumulate private wealth in the name of community development . a suspenseful story to be sure , this may reveal that there is in fact , no community around our hbcus . there are of course over - lapping spaces : church - going folks who have a common history , young people searching for their identity and future , and those who advance themselves using decaying institutions and marginal people as their capital in a climate of hearsay and gossip . the black elite that run our hbcus , even when they quarrel among themselves , do not believe they can trust ordinary black people - the teachers , campus workers , students , and neighbors - to organize themselves and lead their own community institutions . whether stealing or not , they keep information from us that impedes community control ; black faces in high places is not black mass - democratic power . a dynamic self - governing community would educate themselves , with transparent information , and root out the criminals . the abolition of the professional classes , the minority that rules above us , as the embodiment of culture and government , is imperative . those with formal education can advise . but we should probably not trust such people unless they advocate free tuition ( not financial aid and debt ) for all students , and unless they wish no coveted position beyond our authority and limited means . moreover , our hbcu students , workers , and surrounding neighborhood need to organize themselves into popular responsibility councils and assemblies . we need not be invited to participate by anyone but must take the initiative to take over these campuses , the land , and resources . we need to choose our policies first , based on new values different than those held by these black elites , then organize ourselves . only after do we choose our own leaders . we should make hbcu leaders subject to instant recall when they are found to make a mockery out of the project of black self - reliance . this approach might clarify the scandals found at all hbcus not just at arkansas baptist college . attalah nasir can be contacted via email at [ email protected ]

every college basketball fan knows all too well how prevalent upsets can be during any given week of this cantankerous and infinitely enjoyable sport . but this week it was a rough time for any program that had a number next to the name of their respective academic institutions . not only did four of the top 10 teams in the country lose this week , but three of those four supposed top tier programs lost twice simply put , last week was a bombshell of utter chaos and confusion as many perennial national title contenders sustained questionable losses and will have to rebound valiantly if they have any hope of garnering a favorable seed come march madness . while the highly anticipated tournament is still roughly two months away , this is the time where the truly great programs need to separate themselves from the overconfident pretenders that will inevitably continue to drop down the rankings into the dreaded basement of irrelevancy . 1 . villanova wildcats with an offense that both scores ( 87 . 9 ppg ) and moves the basketball effectively ( 17 . 6 apg ) , the wildcats have rarely been reliant on their average defense to help them overcome most of the opponents they have faced in the big east . although no team is safe at the top of the rankings , the wildcats have been merciless when it comes to out scoring their opponents early and are not showing any signs of slowing down in that department . 2 . virginia cavaliers you know that story . the cavaliers are fantastic on defense and play well enough offensively to score aggressively in transition and underneath the basket in half - court situations . if the cavaliers can take out the highly prolific blue devils this week , they will have emphatically proved that a top - ranked defense is more than enough to win consistently and to potentially go far in the ncaa tournament . 3 . purdue boilermakers the only bad thing you can say about the boilermakers is that they have not played a ranked opponent since defeating louisville earlier in the season ( november 28 th ) . with that being said , purdue has done exactly what an elite program is supposed to do : they have almost always handily defeated the unranked opposition they have encountered . with michigan coming into town for a revenge contest , the boilermakers will get another opportunity to prove that they should rightfully be considered one of the best programs in the country . 4 . duke blue devils during their last four games , the duke blue devils have been playing well to fantastic defensively as they have held their opponents to 75 points or less during their four - game winning streak . granted , these impressive defensive showings came against pittsburgh twice , wake forest and miami , but at least duke has finally realized that if they can at least be average at preventing their opponents from scoring that they can be one of the best programs in the country down the stretch of the regular season . 5 . xavier musketeers overcoming seton hall in their latest victory thanks to some impressive shooting late in the game , the musketeers are once again vying for the top spot in the big east . although it would be wishful thinking for the top - ranked wildcats to slip up anytime soon , the musketeers have to be chomping at the bit to get revenge against the wildcats when they face each other again on february 17 th . 6 . kansas jayhawks although a close call win over baylor at home revealed some lingering issues with this programs inconsistency issues when scoring the basketball , their tenacity on the defensive end has been their saving grace in their last three wins . if the jayhawks can get an impressive win over oklahoma this week , they could create some much - desired separation between themselves and the rest of the big 12 . 7 . michigan state spartans although it s been a bumpy road for the spartans in their last four games ( 2 - 2 ) , there is not much doubt how great this team can be on offense and defense when they are firing on all cylinders ( 85 . 2 ppg , 63 . 7 papg ) . considering they do not face a ranked opponent until february 10 th ( purdue ) , the spartans should be able to work out their inconsistency issues without suffering too much in terms of sustaining upset defeats . 8 . cincinnati bearcats although the offense of the bearcats has been anything but productive for the most part , they have actually stepped up impressively in three of their last four games ( have scored 76 points or more in those affairs ) . defensively , the bearcats have been nothing short of terrific as they have not allowed an opponent to score more than 60 total points since december 21 st against cleveland state . 9 . north carolina tar heels holding three of their last four opponents to under 70 total points , the tar heels are beginning to establish themselves as something more than just a relentless shooting program . if the tar heels can consistently stifle opponents defensively while relentlessly shooting the ball at a high rate ( 82 . 7 ppg ) , they could quickly become one of the favorites to win it all by the end of the season . 10 . west virginia mountaineers despite losing two of their last three games , the mountaineers have remained true to their identity of playing dominant defense . however , their offense has come up short in their two recent losses to kansas and texas tech , something that can be fixed fairly easily considering four of their five starters are currently averaging double - digit points per game . 11 . arizona wildcats despite looking wildly inconsistent on offense and defense recently , the scrappy wildcats have been able to play well enough on either side of the court to win tight games down the stretch . in order for the wildcats to continue their winning ways , they will need their electric offense to step consistently if they hope to reach their potential of being considered national title contenders ( 82 . 2 ppg ) . 12 . gonzaga bulldogs against saint mary s , the bulldogs had a grand opportunity to assert themselves as a legitimately competitive program that could at least beat the one competitive opponent in their conference . unfortunately for gonzaga , they were unable to convert on enough possessions to beat a well - rounded saint mary s team that will likely hold onto the top spot in the west coast conference until these two programs face off again in mid - february . 13 . ohio state buckeyes undefeated in big 10 conference play ( 8 - 0 ) , the surprising and highly competitive buckeyes have ground out several impressive victories thanks to their now elite defense ( have held six of their last seven opponents to under 70 total points ) . although they may not have the dominant athletes like some of the perceived elite programs in college basketball , they have enough reliable shooters to assist a defense that is finally starting to hit its stride . 14 . auburn tigers aside from a devastating loss to alabama , the tigers have been a program that has continued to persevere despite being hit particularly hard by the fbi probe that resulted with two of their best players being suspended indefinitely . if they can continue to play the glass this effectively while converting their extra opportunities into points ( 85 . 3 ppg , 72 . 4 papg ) , they could win the sec outright by the end of the regular season . 15 . arizona state sun devils while the sun devils are clearly trending downward , they have been the fortunate beneficiaries of some immense chaos above them while winning enough close games to keep themselves relevant in the pac - 12 . eventually , though , the sun devils will be in danger of dropping out of the rankings if their gifted sharpshooters continue to fail when it comes to carrying this exciting albeit one - dimensional offense . 16 . oklahoma sooners even when superstar trae young scores 48 points in a game ( see the loss to oklahoma state ) , the sooners still do not have what it takes to win against lesser opponents . turning over the ball at an alarming rate of 14 times per game ( young contributes over five turnovers per game ) while allowing 81 . 6 ppg , the sooners are finally being punished for playing too loose with the basketball and are coming to the realization that you need more than an electric offense to win in a sport that is rife with parity and worthy competitors . 17 . texas tech red raiders without question , it was a tough week for some of the top - ranked teams in the big 12 . however , the red raiders arguably suffered the most as they have lost three of their last four games , with their last two losses coming against opponents that are currently in the basement of the big 12 standings ( texas , iowa state ) . while their defense has played enough , it has been their progressively worsening offense that has done them in during this tough stretch ( have not scored more than 75 in their last five games ) . 18 . wichita state shockers one of several top - ranked programs to lose twice last week , the once fearlessly competitive shockers dropped back - t0 - back games to unranked opponents for the first time since november 2015 . while the shockers have the prolific offense to bounce back , their lack of effort on the defensive end recently has to be rectified if they hope to reclaim the moniker of being one of the top programs in college basketball . 19 . saint mary s gaels with a thrilling win against their hated rivals in the gonzaga bulldogs on the road , the gaels have firmly taken hold of the top spot in the west coast conference and will likely hold onto that coveted spot for the remainder of the season . effective on both offense and defense ( 80 . 1 ppg , 65 . 9 papg ) , the gaels have the discipline and personnel to become a dark horse program once the ncaa tournament commences . 20 . tennessee volunteers with a 4 - 3 record in the sec , the volunteers are doing just enough to keep themselves near the top of their conference standings . although their finicky offense is a serious concern ( 77 . 7 ppg ) , the volunteers have been able to overcome their noticeable deficiencies by playing strong defense down the stretch of close games . 21 . clemson tigers while the unlikely success story of the tigers has begun to become less majestic and intriguing in their last four games ( 2 - 2 ) , they have nevertheless remained committed to grinding out tough victorious with an opportunistic defense that prides itself on preventing their opponents from making easy shots ( six bpg ) . it may not always be pretty , but the tigers have an established identity that has proven to be effective more often than not . 22 . michigan wolverines although michigan s anemic offense looked particularly dreadful in a 72 - 52 loss to nebraska last week , the physically imposing wolverines were able to overcome this brutal defeat by winning their other two games last week against both maryland and rutgers . while the wolverines have to establish some type of continuity as a shooting team if they hope to remain in the conversation as a big 10 title contender ( 74 . 5 ppg ) , their relentless defense should be able to carry them until they can establish a more dynamic and competitive presence offensively ( 62 . 5 papg ) . 23 . kansas state wildcats although the wildcats are not particularly dominant on either offense or defense , they are a team that knows how to play the big boys of their conference extremely tough ( won two of their last three games , all contests were against ranked opponents ) . if this team can continue to be tenacious when it comes to forcing turnovers ( eight spg ) they could find themselves being one of the top dogs in the incredibly competitive and deep big 12 conference . 24 . creighton blue jays considering how this season has transpired for the blue jays thus far , this program should have a place reserved in spots 23 - 25 of the rankings every other week . just when it appears that the blue jays are going cold shooting wise and lack a sufficient defense to be competitive , they somehow manage to rally and pull off an impressive win over a conference opponent . with the blue jays facing the deadly wildcats in a couple of weeks , it becomes fair to wonder if this team has the potential to become a sleeper contender if they can play great basketball consistently . 25 . rhode island rams over the past couple of weeks , the defensively scrappy rams have been flirting with a spot in the top - 25 and have sneaked their way in the rankings this week due to the immense amount of chaos above them . currently riding a 10 game winning streak , the rams may have just enough going for them defensively to remain highly competitive in the a - 10 conference ( 66 . 7 papg ) . view gallery

forests in southern australia are littered with the bodies of thousands of young flying foxes after a dangerous heat wave . sustained temperatures over 47 degrees celsius have created a hostile environment for the local megabats , especially those younger and more vulnerable . despite heroic efforts from volunteers , the death toll is rising . animal welfare groups have been fighting to save the lives of the remaining afflicted creatures , treating dehydration and exhaustion with subcutaneous fluids meant to cool down and rehydrate . a campaign entitled help save the wildlife and bushlands in campbelltown has shared devastating images of the corpses in an effort to raise environmental awareness . the group frequently posts information about the species importance within the local ecosystem . flying foxes are intelligent and remarkable , the group says . these unique animals help regenerate our forests and keep ecosystems healthy through pollination and seed dispersal . they don t use sonar - like smaller , insect - eating bats ; only their eyes and ears , like us . they see as well as a cat at night and are just about as smart . flying foxes are foresters keeping the ecosystem together . if we are to keep the remnants of our forests healthy , we need the flying foxes . the two are inseparable . volunteers have also been hosing down koalas to keep them hydrated . extreme high temperatures in three states have melted highway asphalt and sparked bushfires threatening more than just the wildlife . on saturday , approximately four hundred houses lost electricity with over fifty fires reported . raging fires destroyed several buildings on the outskirts of melbourne , australia s second - largest city and capital of the state of victoria . the world weather attribution team and colleagues from the university of new south wales attribute the record - breaking heat to climate change , prompting the australian bureau of meteorology to issue a special climate statement . moreover , the states of victoria and south australia have issued emergency weather warnings , advising rural populations to avoid exposure by seeking shelter away from the untamed blaze . fortunately , meteorologist predictions are able to give ample warning ahead of such conditions . emergency management commissioner craig lapsley recapitulated the destructive potential of dry summer weather combined with strong winds , telling a news conference : it s exactly what the forecast indicated . meanwhile , the battle to save the flying foxes continues . first responder cate ryan spoke to the press , depicting a grisly scene with piles of corpses and dying bats strewn across the ground . pictures on social media have gained much attention , sparking conversation and further evidencing the disastrous effects of recent abnormal weather patterns . as weather authorities maintain a watchful eye , reasonable predictions suggest similar incidents may become more frequent , with temperatures on the rise and heat records breaking every year . many animal welfare groups including the help save the wildlife and bushlands in campbelltown campaign continue to actively seek help in maintaining and supporting local wildlife . those interested are encouraged to help in any way possible . images of the young , winged survivors have been circulating across various online platforms , providing hope and motivation for such extensive communal efforts .
most people have , at some point in their lives , debated over the comparative intelligence of canines and felines . if you re particularly partial to one or the other , you likely have your opinion coming to the forefront of your thoughts . while many of us have personal biases resulting from preferences and experience , the scientific verdict is in , and it doesn t look good for cat - lovers . according to the findings of a team of international researchers , dogs are quantifiably smarter than cats . dogs possess on average twice the amount of neurons the brain cells responsible for information - processing than cats . neurons electrically - excitable cells process , receive , and transmit information through chemical and electrical signals . scientists concluded dogs higher neuron count results in significant advantages in information processing abilities , and considering the wide gap in neuron count averages , the two species have an ensuing and marked gap in intelligence . the study , conducted by researchers from six universities in the us , brazil , denmark and south africa , has been accepted for publication in the journal frontiers in neuroanatomy . suzana herculano - houzel , an associate professor of psychology and biological sciences , led and conducted the research in her lab at vanderbilt university . while researchers comparing animal species intelligence had been using the more limited method of comparing brain size , in 2005 , my lab developed a very simple , fast and inexpensive method to count cells in brains and brain parts , herculano - houzel said . the method requires flattened pieces of brain tissue to be homogenized in a pyrex tenbroeck tissue grinder and kept in solution to help to break down cell walls and release the cell nuclei . by turning brain matter into a soup - like substance , researchers were able to count the freed - up cell nuclei under a microscope . examining both species cerebral cortex the information - processing center , for laymen found cats brains to contain around 250 million neurons , while an average 15 - pound mixed - breed dog s brain contains 429 million neurons . it is fair to say , then , that dogs have about twice as many neurons as cats in their cerebral cortex , herculano - houzel said . and this implies that dogs have more cognitive capabilities than cats . analysis of a 64 - pound golden retriever yielded an even higher count of 627 million neurons , allowing for the inference that certain larger breeds of dogs may have even more pronounced processing advantages than the average two - fold difference between similarly - sized animals . the cognitive gap may seem clear to most after receiving this information , but don t expect cat - lovers to take this news lying down the love for one species over the other is less rooted in science and logic , and more in personal preference , so perhaps this study does little for the general debate over the superior domestic companion . while the results of this study may be a tough break cat - lovers , at least dog - lovers now have a scientifically - proven trump - card to pull out next time a rendition of this heated debate gets underway . either way , if your grandma is a cat - fanatic , you may want to break the news gently to her and expect her to come back with many examples to the contrary .
when the staff at the australian reptile park realized that a spider s egg sack was ready to burst , they hurried to grab their camera and set it up to capture all the nightmarish scene . and as a result , you ll see hundreds , if not over a thousand , baby spiders emerging from their egg sack and crawling out into the world . these spiders are deadly , and the resulting video will make put your gag reflex to the test . watch as the staff members of the reptile park film theses tiny , venomous , and extremely deadly funnel web spiders emerging into the world . the park harvests funnel web spiders venom to produce a life - saving anti - venom in the unfortunate case when someone is bitten by a dangerous spider . to get the venom from these tiny deadly creatures , the staff members must milk the funnel web spiders for their venom . to raise awareness and gross thousands of people out , the park filmed the birth of these funnel web spiders . and as you will see when you press play ( and you re going to press play because it is just too disturbing of a video to ignore ) , the staff member uses tweezers to rip open the spider egg sack and help the little ones out into the world . after filming the clip , they shared it on their facebook page where it quickly gained international attention . they wrote the following caption to accompany the video : baby funnel web spiders coming out of an egg sack is the stuff of some people s nightmares but we love them the park loves the spiders because they collect their venom to save lives in the case of a fatal spider bite . kane christensen works as the head of spiders at the australian reptile park . he spoke to the daily mail australia about the funnel web spiders and their use for their venom . the venom is used by biocsL , to manufacture anti - venom that saves spider bite victims , christensen said . the egg - hatching video only shows the tip of the iceberg , so to speak . the park has a dozen more spider eggs ready to go . i m a proud dad with all those babies , he said . the australian reptile park is the only place in the country of australia that supplies the venom that is needed to create anti - venom for the funnel web spiders bite . the process can be very difficult . male spiders do not produce venom until they are four - years - old . that means christensen and his team have to wait a lot and breeds lots of spiders over the years . christensen leads his specially trained team to milk more than 150 funnel web spiders every two weeks . they need to do it that often if they hope to produce enough venom to supply enough for the anti - venom . each egg would have an average of 100 spiders inside each one , but last week one gave us 175 little spiders , which was awesome . since the anti - venom has been produced , no fatalities have resulted from a bite of a funnel web spider . christensen and his team are doing profound work and saving lives .
in the youtube video below , you re going to see what can happen when you teach children how to use guns at a young age . although this little princess is only seven - years - old , she is out hunting deer with a gun that looks to be about twice her size . and now that the video has gone viral because her reaction to killing the animal was utterly priceless , this little girl is the talk of facebook . and the clip has been gotten more than 2 . 5 million hits on various video platforms . the little girl in the video is lilly klapper , and she lives in north texas . while out hunting for whitetail with her father and brother , lilly was ready to take her first shot at a living animal . her family trained her well during the last two years . she has done a lot of target practice and has been mentally preparing for the hunt . but nothing could have prepared her for the thRill of making a direct hit and taking down the deer . the girl s father , cory klapper , is a dedicated hunter . and he was the one to get the monumental moment on video . although the hunt happened back on november 28 , klapper finally got the footage onto facebook only this tuesday . and before he knew what was happening , his beloved daughter , lilly , had become a viral sensation and the talk of the internet . we have a passion for the outdoors , and it was primarily intended to be for family and friends , klapper told foX 4 . but now i hope that it inspires other parents to get their children into the outdoors . lilly is manning an aR - style rifle chambered in 300 blackouts bullets , her dad said . she is completely focused on killing the whitetail . shoot the big one in the middle if you can , her dad encourages the young girl . she listens to his advice and aims . then she prepares to pull the trigger . it takes two minutes before the shot presents itself , but when it does , she pulls the trigger , and everyone erupts into celebration . you got it , baby you got it her father cheers . the excitement takes a while to make sense to her . but when she realizes that she s killed her first deer , her mouth hangs open and turns into a big smile . people around the country shared their support to the hunting family . this is amazing that s a dad teaching some life skills right there wrote one facebook user . sUch a gREat dad i have never hunted and hated seeing the animals in africa hunted and all that , but this is so awesome what you did with your daughter , another added . you can see how proud she is of herself she is so focused and patient go dad one admirer added , we have become a nation of powder puffs . thank god for dads like you . am teaching my grandson to shoot . kids need this , as it teaches responsible behavior . and as a great hunter once said : a family that hunts together stays together . what s your reaction to the footage
tuesday brought an endless stream of new revelations in the mueller investigation of donald trump s alleged obstruction of justice and his campaign s alleged collusion with russian government operatives . witness interviews included even members of the president s most inner circle , as well as interviews of witnesses to the acts that to even the most untrained eye appear to constitute obstruction by the president . in the latest news of a string of witnesses to have been interviewed comes former cia director mike pompeo as well as former acting attorney general sally yates . the country watched with growing alarm as yates testified in front of the senate judiciary committee in may 2017 , but her cooperation in the mueller probe was kept under wraps until now . yates was the first to sound the alarm to donald trump s administration about the potential compromise they faced with michael flynn serving as a national security adviser . yates went to white house counsel don mcgahn on january 26 , 2017 to warn that the russian government had blackmail power over flynn , yet flynn was not fired until february 13 . in the nearly three weeks between yates warning and flynn s firings , mcgahn took the allegations that flynn may have even committed crimes seriously enough to begin researching those acts and their legal consequences . the white house turned over records this fall to special counsel robert mueller revealing that in the very first days of the trump presidency , don mcgahn researched federal law dealing both with lying to federal investigators and with violations of the logan act , a centuries - old federal law that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments , according to three people with direct knowledge of the confidential government documents . while it may have taken nearly three weeks for flynn s crimes to be addressed by the white house by firing him , it only took five days for yates herself to be fired after warning mcgahn about flynn . all of these details are of special interest to robert mueller and his investigators , and flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the fBi upon being indicted for the crime . a second interview also provides insight into the direction of the mueller investigation . former cia director mike pompeo was both a peripheral witness to the firing of former fBi director james comey , who was pressured by trump to drop the investigation into michael flynn . pompeo himself was also leaned on by trump to pressure comey to drop the investigation , making him a key witness in the probe of trump s alleged obstruction of justice . flynn s tenure in the white house and his firing by trump are among the topics mueller s team has been asking witnesses to discuss , and they are likely to be part of any questioning of the president . separately , mueller is expected to want to ask trump about his firing of comey . the president told nBc news last year that his decision was connected to comey s dogged pursuit of potential ties between the trump campaign and russia . trump has repeatedly called the investigation a hoax and a witch - hunt . mueller is expected to begin laying the groundwork to question the president in the coming weeks . featured image via getty / the asahi shimbun
s the potemkin village walls of the left ' s ' trump collusion ' narrative crash and burn along with special counsel mueller ' s credibility , the new york post ' s michael goodwin sees far more wide - ranging problems ahead for america ' s ' intelligence ' agencies as the anti - trump ' secret society ' and lovers - texts - gate debacles threaten the core of the deep state . goodwin writes that , during the financial crisis , the federal government bailed out banks it declared too big to fail . fearing their bankruptcy might trigger economic armageddon , the feds propped them up with taxpayer cash . something similar is happening now at the fbi , with the washington wagons circling the agency to protect it from charges of corruption . this time , the appropriate tag line is too big to believe . yet each day brings credible reports suggesting there is a massive scandal involving the top ranks of america s premier law enforcement agency . the reports , which feature talk among agents of a secret society and suddenly missing text messages , point to the existence both of a cabal dedicated to defeating donald trump in 2016 and of a plan to let hillary clinton skate free in the classified email probe . if either one is true and i believe both probably are it would mean fbi leaders betrayed the nation by abusing their powers in a bid to pick the president . more support for this view involves the fbi s use of the russian dossier on trump that was paid for by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee . it is almost certain that the fbi used the dossier to get fisa court warrants to spy on trump associates , meaning it used the opposition research of the party in power to convince a court to let it spy on the candidate of the other party likely without telling the court of the dossier s political link . even worse , there is growing reason to believe someone in president barack obama s administration turned over classified information about trump to the clinton campaign . as one former federal prosecutor put it , it doesn t get worse than that . that prosecutor , joseph digenova , believes trump was correct when he claimed obama aides wiretapped his phones at trump tower . these and other elements combine to make a toxic brew that smells to high heaven , but most americans don t know much about it . mainstream media coverage has been sparse and dismissive and there s a blackout from the same democrats obsessed with russia , russia , russia . partisan motives aside , it s as if a scandal of this magnitude is more than america can bear so let s pretend there s nothing to see and move along . but , thankfully the disgraceful episode won t be washed away , thanks to a handful of congressional republicans , led by california rep . devin nunes , chairman of the house s permanent select committee on intelligence . after he accused the fbi of stonewalling in turning over records , the bureau relented , at least partially . the result was clear evidence of bias against trump by officials charged with investigating him and clinton . those same agents appear to have acted on that bias to tilt the election to clinton . in one text message , an agent suggests that attorney general loretta lynch knew while the investigation was still going on that the fbi would not recommend charges against clinton . how could she know unless the fix was in all roads in the explosive developments lead to james comey , whose boy scout image belied a sinister belief that he , like his infamous predecessor j . edgar hoover , was above the law . it is why i named him j . edgar comey last year and wrote that he was adept at using innuendo and leaks to let everybody in washington know they could be the next to be investigated . it was in the office of comey s top deputy , andrew mccabe , where agents discussed an insurance policy in the event that trump won . reports indicated that the russia - collusion probe was that insurance policy . the text was from peter strzok , the top investigator on the trump case , and was sent to lisa page , an fbi lawyer and also his mistress . i want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in andy s office that there s no way he gets elected but i m afraid we can t take that risk . it s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you re 40 . . . strzok wrote . it is frightening that strzok , who called trump an idiot , was the lead investigator on both the clinton and trump cases . after these messages surfaced , special counsel robert mueller removed strzok and page from his probe , though both still work at the fbi . strzok , despite his talk of an insurance policy in 2016 , wrote in may of 2017 that he was skeptical mueller s probe would find anything on trump because there s no big there there . talk about irony . while dems and the left - wing media already found trump guilty of collusion before mueller was appointed , the real scandal might be the conduct of the probers themselves . suspicions are hardly allayed by the fact that the fbi says it can t find five months of messages between strzok and page , who exchanged an estimated 50 , 000 messages overall . the missing period dec . 14 , 2016 through may 17 , 2017 was a crucial time in washington . there were numerous leaks of classified material just before and after trump s inauguration on jan . 20 . and the president fired comey last may 9 , provoking an intense lobbying effort for a special counsel , which led to mueller s appointment on may 19 . jeff sessions , the attorney general , has emerged from his hidey hole to notice that the fbi has run amok , and said monday he would leave no stone unturned to find the five months of missing texts . fine , but the house is racing ahead of him . nunes has prepared a four - page memo , based on classified material that purportedly lays out what the fbi and others did to corrupt the election . a movement to release the memo is gaining steam , but congress says it might take weeks . why wait americans can handle the truth , no matter how big it is .

ever wonder what s on the mind of today s most notable people well , don t miss our unbelievable roundup of the best and most talked about quotes of the day :
the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , who is a known muslim sympathizer , uses his christmas address to lash out against tyrannical and populist world leaders in a christmas message seen as a thinly disguised rebuke against us president donald trump . in november , he said , i really , genuinely do not understand christian support for trump with a very slight sneer of theo - political superiority , which isn t at all uncommon among the bishops of the church of england : breitbart justin welby was preaching at canterbury cathedral at the same time as pope francis made oblique criticism of trump in his traditional christmas address in st peter s square in vatican city , ( comparing mary and joseph to the muslim freeloaders , rapists , and jihadists pretending to be refugees invading europe ) the pontiff made particular reference to the situation in the middle east just two weeks after the us president inflamed tensions in the region by controversially recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel . in canterbury , welby told worshippers that much could be learnt from the nativity story , where jesus is power seen in humility . it wasn t long ago that this archbishop warned against developing a culture of fear towards muslims in britain and said the proportion of muslims in britain who are radicalized remained extraordinarily small . uk - dhimmi - archbishop - of - canterbury - says - there - is - too - much - hysteria - over - islamization - and - muslim - radicalization the bishop of liverpool , paul bayes , also attacks christians who support president donald trump and a system which builds walls instead of bridges . breitbart paul bayes , a senior figure in the church of england , also appeared to argue that backing rightwing populism could be incompatible with biblical teaching . he said he regretted that people who call themselves evangelical in the us seem to be uncritically accepting positions taken by trump and his allies . his intervention comes just days after the archbishop of canterbury , who leads the church , used his christmas address to target so - called tyrannical and populist world leaders widely perceived as a dig at mr . trump . adding to the politicised onslaught , mr . bayes told the british left - wing guardian newspaper : some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalises the poor , a system which builds walls instead of bridges , a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded , a system which says we re not welcoming people any more into our country . bayes ( below ) even slammed trump / brexit voters who bow the knee to hate by tweeting this nauseatingly fake amazon commercial featuring a muslim imam and a catholic priest , trying to make you think that muslims and christians in real life are bffs . not all the archbishops agreed with this tweet : i guess these archbishops wouldn t approve of what trump had to say about christian vs muslim refugees coming into the u . s .

louis burke culture contact a 17 - year study has concluded that the removal a song lyric regarding a fictional character bringing a fake gun to school in the song teenage dirtbag by wheatus has , unfortunately , done nothing to end gun violence in the usa . the lyric in question references a boyfriend who is stated to be a dick and brings a gun to school , the latter lyric being edited out of the radio , tV and streaming edit as a clever way to end gun violence without actually doing anything to end gun violence . former president and escaped jim henson puppet , george w . bush stated this finding is particularly disappointing as they were waiting for the results of this study to come back before doing anything to stop gun violence in the usa . if replacing a lyric about a make believe gun with a fake record scratch has not managed to stop people from getting access to guns then i m not sure what else we can do to stop the killing of innocent americans . many americans are upset to discover that censoring a lyric from a song featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 jason biggs film , loser , did not have the groundbreaking impact on the us gun epidemic everyone was hoping for . in the centre of this party of disappointed americans is none other than lead singer of wheatus , brendan b . brown , who hoped the censorship of his biggest hit would at least do something to decrease ease of access to firearms in america . at least there haven t been as many shootings in high schools now . sure , 13 , 286 americans were killed by guns in 2015 alone , but not as many in high schools . there were way more in colleges , shopping centres , nightclubs , workplaces , cinemas and concerts than there were in high schools so let s not treat this as a complete failure . one additional finding of the study suggests that lyrical content does not necessarily have a direct effect on behaviour , something lead singer of iron maiden , bruce dickinson , will happily attest to . we didn t see any sort of increase in ticket sales from the release of that song . no increase of teenage dirtbags at our shows , just the usual middle - aged dirtbags who only ever wear our t - shirts . for citizens of the usa this comes as another critical blow to their abusive relationship with an amendment written at a point in time where someone could simply take over your farm by killing you . president donald trump says no action will be taken until they see the findings of the washington bullets becoming the washington wizards study and someone is able to explain them to him on a fox news morning show .

clancy overell editor contact leader of the opposition , bill shorten has today made a bold attempt at winning over youth voters by posting his very first neknominate video just 46 months after the brief viral trend rose to prominence . it is not yet known which recent melbourne university law graduate working as an advisor and confidante of the labor - right identity was behind the idea , but it has caused collective groans right through his own party , and australia as a whole . the game became popular in early 2014 , and as it spread it escalated , with nominees performing the challenge in more extreme circumstances , drinking more potent beverages or engaging in dangerous activities either during or immediately after consuming their beverage . it was three years ago when bill shorten was was originally neknominated by sam dastyari , the labor - right darling at the time but due to his newfound position as leader of the alp , shorten thought all that was needed to be elected was a squeaky brand . however in the post - truth populist political climate , this is no longer the case . i next nominate you penny [ hahah ] said shorten in a monotone voice that made him sound as though he was reading quite slowly from a teleprompter . neknominate , also known as neck and nominate , neknomination or neck nomination , is an online drinking game . the original rules of the game require the participants to film themselves drinking a pint of an alcoholic beverage , usually beer , in one gulp and upload the footage to the web . a participant then nominates another person to do the same , which has to be done within 24 hours . it has been reported that shorten latched onto this idea after seeing former prime minister bob hawke managing to remain relevant at the sydney test last week , and demanded that his staffers find him a funny and relatable way to binge drink on camera . his video , posted to facebook last night has so far received 150 likes from mostly labor staffers and friends of his wife .
louis burke culture cONtact before beginning his private celebration of bbQ and beverages ( swordfish steak and vintage penfolds ) prime minister malcolm turnbull took a chance to address to the mounting controversy of australia day stating it is a non - issue . it s a day to recognise our history and celebrate together , just as the settlers and indigenous australians did when they first met on this most amazing day . with many citizens unconvinced by this response , turnbull took things a step further and urged anyone with problems regarding the date of australia day to take it up with opposition leader bill shorten . look , australia day is for all australians no matter how our stories began . but if you disagree you should know its entirely labor s fault . citing australia becoming a nationwide day of celebration and eventually a public holiday during the hawke and keating years , turnbull stated those against the date need to consider that australia day is the fault of politicians they were too young to have voted for . they sowed this seed back under whitlam . it s their fault amidst some activists calling his comments discriminative , turnbull was quick to remind them he can t be as he has a granddaughter with chinese heritage , something bill shorten certainly doesn t have . journalists from left - wing youth publications were quick to remind turnbull that while some fault does lie with left - leaning politicians from 25 years ago , he himself does have the power to change the date . if it s such a hot topic , i don t know , maybe we can have another plebiscite or something . the last one was such a success after all .

( screenshot : facebook ) dr . melina abdullah , professor and chair of pan - african studies at california state university gets ready to summon the spiritual energy of victims of officer involved shootings at the hollywood united methodist church in hollywood , california , on thursday january 11 , 2018 . dr . melina abdullah , professor and chair of pan - african studies at california state university , recently conducted a libation ceremony inside the hollywood united methodist church to summon the spiritual energy of dead civil rights leaders and other blacks who died at the hands of police officers . author and christian scholar dr . hamilton ayuk argued on his blog that the pouring of libation to honor any spirit other than the god of the bible is contrary to scripture . speaking at the church where advocates had gathered to discuss their opposition to a 3 . 5 billion jail expansion plan in los angeles county along with the issue of mass incarceration , abdullah , who is one of the original organizers of the black lives matter movement , argued that because the issue of mass incarceration was also a spiritual struggle , it was important to conduct the libation ritual to summon the energy of those who had died in the struggle for civil rights . " this is not just a social justice , a racial justice , an economic justice struggle , " abdullah said . " this is also a spiritual struggle , so it ' s appropriate that we ' re here in this setting ( a church ) . and it ' s also important that we summon the right energy into this space no matter what faith you are . we have to understand what the struggle is about . " she continued : " making sure that jails don ' t expand is a first step . we don ' t want cages at all . our people don ' t belong in cages at all . and we understand that there is a direct relationship , our ancestors demand that we engage in this work because as an african person in this country we know we were brought over here as chattel and once they banned the slave plantations , many of those plantations were warped into prisons so they continue to enslave us . so this is ancestral and spiritual work that we must do . so we are going to pour libation in the names of our ancestors , in the names of those who struggle right now . " she then proceeded to pour what appeared to be bottled water as she summoned the energy of the dead while declaring " ashe . " " we summon those spirits that are still with us . we summon those people whose bodies have been stolen , but whose souls are still here , " she said . " we call on wakiesha wilson . we call on george jackson . . . eric garner . . . " " and all of those whose bodies have been stolen : we ask that you be with us . we ask that you work through us . we ask that we do righteous work on your behalf , " abdullah continued inside the church . " we call on martin luther king into this space . brother malcom [ x ] , we call you into this space . ashe . . . . nat turner , into this space . ashe . mother harriet tubman . ashe . we call you all into this space . we ask that you work through us . that you give us power ; that the creator give us power when we come together . this victory is assured . ashe . ashe . ashe , " she ended . the practice of libation is a common practice in some african - american churches like unity fellowship church of baltimore where they conduct the ritual to " honor the ancestors . those who in one way or another helped us to get to where we are today . " according to dr . ayuk , however , while libation can be found in the bible it was " done as a form of worship to god and not gods . " heathens , he said , " copied the practice and when israel strayed from god , they took the ritual to heathen gods " and most african communities currently pour libation as a part of their tradition . " the practice is said to have begun in israel when jacob intended to appease god with a drink offering and oil ( gen 35 : 14 ) . although from genesis 1 - 35 there is a mirror that captured the culture of the surrounding nations , there is no indication any of them performed the ritual before this time , " ayuk wrote . " drifting away from god has nefarious consequences . perhaps that is why most african countries entrenched in ancestral worship are backwards because they seem to invite more the wrath rather than the favor of god . from africa to asia , latin america to europe and north america to central america , there is enough evidence that abandoning the ways of god will fetch us disaster now and hell fire in the world to come , " ayuk added .

" while abe said it is yet to be confirmed that the boat came from north korea , cnn said police also found a badge with the likenesses of north korean leaders kim jong il and kim il sung inside the boat , along with a cigarette box with korean letters . as many as 113 suspected north korean vessels dubbed " ghost ships " washed up in japan in 2017 , carrying the decomposing bodies of 43 people . the victims are believed to be mostly fishing crews driven by hunger and desperation further out into the sea between the korean peninsula and japan . several north korean defectors spoke last year about the extreme poverty and starvation gripping many citizens under kim jong un ' s regime . christians suffer heavily there too , and are often sent to prison camps or executed if their faith is discovered . the discovery of this year ' s first ghost ship coincides with news that north and south korea will march under the same flag for the opening of the winter olympic games , which will take place between feb . 9 25 in pyeongchang , south korea . BBc news reported that the two countries will also field a joint women ' s ice hockey team . while the apparent thawing in relations means that the cross - border road between the two nations will be opened for the first time in two years , some , such as japan ' s foreign minister taro kono , have warned against north korea ' s sudden " charm offensive . " " it is not the time to ease pressure or to reward north korea , " kono said , according to reuters . " the fact that north korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working , " he added , referring to heavy international sanctions against the north . just last month kim jong un was still issuing grave warnings against the united states , and said during his new year ' s day speech that his country has the capability to hit u . s . mainland with nuclear weapons . " the entire united states is within range of our nuclear weapons , and a nuclear button is always on my desk . this is reality , not a threat , " kim said . " this year we should focus on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment , " the north korean leader added . " these weapons will be used only if our security is threatened . "

" original report : martin luther king jr . ' s niece is speaking out against facebook ' s decision to ban paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to her upcoming documentary that highlights the " real untold story " of abortion in the united states and the history of eugenics associated with planned parenthood . alveda king , a prominent christian conservative and pro - life activist who serves as director of civil rights for the unborn at priests for life , spoke with family research council ' s tony perkins during a special national religious freedom day broadcast of his radio show on tuesday and explained that facebook pulled down paid ads and is blocking shares for her upcoming film , " roe v , wade . " named after the 1973 u . s . supreme court decision that legalized elective abortions , the documentary stars hollywood actor jon voight and is said to be the first movie ever to expose " the real untold story of how people lied ; how the media lied ; and how the courts were manipulated to pass a law that has since killed over 60 million americans . " expand collapse ( photo : reuters / mary f . calvert ) alveda king , founder of alveda king ministries , speaks during an " i have a dream " gospel brunch at the willard intercontinental hotel in washington , d . c . , on august 25 , 2013 . " there is a new movie coming out ' roe v . wade . ' i am one of the executive producers . facebook has pulled down our ads , the paid ads and any mention of the non - paid ads , " king said while addressing the topic of religious freedom . " they do not want the message of the injustice of abortion broadcast and they are trying to block that . " king is referring to facebook ' s blocking of ads promoting the movie ' s indiegogo crowdfunding account . thus far , the movie has raised just under 44 , 000 out of its stated goal of 2 million . " that is another violation of religious freedom . it ' s very discriminatory , " she continued . " so , when we are denied the opportunity and the right to proclaim the gospel freely in this nation that was founded upon . . . that right , it ' s a terrible injustice . my uncle did say injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . i know we can all agree . it ' s wrong to take the life of a baby in the womb . it ' s wrong to silence those voices of people who want to proclaim our faith and all of those aren ' t just civil rights injustices , but they are an injustice against god ' s will . " according to an update on the crowdfunding page , " facebook has banned us from inviting friends to ' like ' our page and from ' sharing ' our paid ads . " the christian post has reached out to facebook for comment on the situation . a response is pending . " it is outrageous that facebook purports to be apolitical when there have been trends of blocking pages of conservative causes , such as our ' roe v . wade ' movie page , " fellow executive producer jalesia mcqueen told breitbart in a statement . the news comes as facebook is frequently criticized for having bias against and censoring conservative christians . earlier this month , facebook unpublished the popular facebook page of warriors for christ ministry , which had over 225 , 000 followers and spoke critically of things like homosexuality , transgenderism and abortion . facebook told the christian post that the page was removed because it violated its policies on hate speech and bullying . additionally , facebook refused to take action this week after popular christian mommy blogger elizabeth johnston , best known as " the activist mommy , " voiced concern with a facebook group that was titled " i will find activist mommy and burn whoever runs it alive . " officials of the social media giant ruled that the group did not violate facebook community standards because it was determined that the group was " satirical . " " with 2 billion users , it can be argued that facebook has become a public utility and thus cannot discriminate against users based upon their political or religious views , " johnston told cp on tuesday . " conservative users who don ' t tow the liberal line on issues like islam , abortion , and homosexuality are repeatedly banned and silenced in an orwellian manner for expressing their valid concerns , thus causing conservatives to cry out for an alternative platform that welcomes the free exchange of ideas .

( screencap : youtube / tidningen dagen ) annahita parsan ( l ) , minister in the church of sweden , in a video posted on april 28 , 2017 . an iranian convert to christianity who is now an ordained minister in the church of sweden says she has helped bring nearly 1 , 500 muslims to christ over the past five years . annahita parsan told fox news in a report on wednesday that her life , which has undergone huge tribulations , is " completely different since coming to jesus . " the minister said she was raised in a muslim home in iran and married at 16 , though a couple of years later her husband was killed in a car accident . she had to fight for custody for her son , which she successfully won , and two years later was re - married to a man whose wife had died . her second husband started beating her son , and although she wanted a divorce it was impossible for her to do because she was pregnant with a second child . parsan , her daughter , and the rest of the family fled as refugees in 1984 in the wake of the iran - iraq conflict , but met great hardships , including spending a month in prison in turkey because they did not have identification papers or passports . eventually they made it to denmark , which is where parsan started learning more about jesus christ . " in about the first or second month there , a woman came to the door to speak about god . but it was not in my interest , " parsan said . " i was so angry , i was so unhappy . but she came back the next day with a small bible , so this time i asked jesus to help me . " she started reading the bible , which she had to keep secret from her husband , and grew in the faith . but her family life only got worse and she attempted to take her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills after her husband physically attacked her . she survived the assault and that was when she woke up in a hospital and realized she was being called for greater things . " i was too scared to go home and the police came to the hospital to talk to me . many people were helping me find a safe place to live , and i knew it was jesus , " parsan recalled . " and soon , the police called to tell me that they had uncovered a plot in which my abusive husband had planned to kidnap the children back to iran . after that , we moved to sweden , and the policeman told me that i have an angel on my shoulder . " two years after moving to sweden she was baptized in the christian faith . in 2006 , she survived a car accident , which is when she said she realized god spared her life so that she could help muslims come to christ . in 2012 , parson became a minister in the church of sweden , focusing much of her work on reaching out to the muslim community and inviting them to explore the faith . she has helped as many as 1 , 500 come to christ in the past five years , she estimates , despite risks to her life . " i have serious threats at least a couple of times per year , a threat of a knife attack or a bomb attack . i have a police officer attached to my case i can always call , and we have security during our services . i have other threats from my own distant family members , " she revealed . " but for me , what i do is worth it . " christians back in iran meanwhile continue suffering intense persecution for their faith , believers have said , despite the claims of a prominent bishop who attempted to argue that they " enjoy complete freedom . " bishop sibo sarkisian , the armenian - orthodox bishop of tehran , said last month that iran grants christian citizens " every right to practice their faith , including observing their feasts such as christmas , " and said that the only thing they are prohibited from doing is sharing their faith publicly . mohabat news , which says it is the news agency of iranian christians , pointed out , however , that for millions of believers , including the growing numbers in iran , evangelism is a biblical mandate , and is an essential part of the faith .
( screenshot : youtube / mjoflakeland1 ) a metro bus crosses an intersection out front of the paul s . sarbanes transit center in silver spring , maryland in a video posted to youtube on apr 10 , 2016 . the united states justice department said that the washington , d . c . public transit system violated the free speech rights of the catholic archdiocese of washington by refusing to place it ' s christmas advertisement on the side of metro buses . the department of justice filed a 14 - page amicus brief with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia on tuesday in defense of the archdiocese , which is suing the washington metropolitan area transit authority after its bus advertisement for the " find the perfect gift " christmas campaign was rejected . the advertisement showed a silhouette of three shepherds and their sheep under a starry night . the advertisement also promoted the website , " findtheperfectgift . org . " upon clicking the link , the page reads " jesus is the perfect gift . " wmata maintained that the ad was rejected because it violated guidelines that state that advertisements may not promote or oppose and religion or belief . the archdiocese filed a lawsuit against the agency in november . however , a federal judge in december sided with wmata , saying that the agency has the right to ban posters that have religious content . although the christmas season has ended , the archdiocese is continuing its legal battle because it intends to place similar ads in the future and wants wmata ' s policy struck down . attorney general jeff sessions ' justice department is now asking the court of appeals to overturn the federal judge ' s ruling . " wmata ' s rejection of the archdiocese ' s proposed christmas advertisement in this case falls squarely within the class of viewpoint discrimination . . . . , " the justice department brief reads . " in the context of christmas advertising , wmata ' s guidelines permit messages which generally express commercial or charitable viewpoints , but exclude messages that express religious viewpoints . " " had macy ' s , for example , sought to run a christmas - themed ad stating , ' find the perfect gift , ' and displaying an image of its jewelry , nothing in the guidelines would prohibit the company from doing so . but because the archdiocese ' s proposal arguably conveyed the implicit message that ' jEsus is the perfect gift , ' wmata rejected it , " the brief continued . " an ad proclaiming that the perfect christmas gift is jewelry and another that the perfect christmas gift is jesus obviously offer competing perspectives on the meaning of the holiday , yet wmata permits only the former . " the justice department argues that the the application of wmata ' s guidelines is " precisely the type of viewpoint discrimination " that the supreme court precluded in the 1995 case of rosenberger v . university of virginia , in which the court ruled that the public school may not withhold funding from a christian student publication that is otherwise available to secular student publications . " as the supreme court has made clear , the first amendment prohibits the government from discriminating against religious viewpoints , " associate attorney general rachel brand said in a statement . " by rejecting the archdiocese ' s advertisement while allowing other christmas advertisements , wmata engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination . " according to the washingtonian magazine , metro ' s policy was revised after pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative attempted to place ads featuring cartoon depictions of the muslim prophet muhammad . since taking office in 2017 , sessions and president donald trump have vowed to promote religious liberty . last october , sessions issued a sweeping order on religious freedom , calling on federal agencies to ensure that the religious freedom of people and organizations are protected to the " greatest extent practicable and permitted by law . "
( screenshot : chick - fil - a ) a chick - fil - a restaurant proudly displays the companies " closed sunday " policy . it ' s a practice that has been in place since 1946 . a chick - fil - a restaurant in fargo , north dakota , is asking for forgiveness following a controversial decision to kick out a mother for breast - feeding her child , with the owner being accused of telling the woman that men can see her " indecency . " macy hornung , the mother , wrote in a facebook message on sunday that she was told to leave the restaurant after staff saw her breast - feeding her baby . " the owner came to our table where i was showing no more than the upper portion of my breast , barely more than what was visible in my shirt and asked me to cover . i tried to explain that i couldn ' t , because my baby refuses to be covered and she started harping about the children and men who can see my indecency and i need to cover , " hornung explained . " i said they could practice the simple art of looking away and tried to cite north dakota breast - feeding laws . she told me if i chose not to cover , then she would have to ask me to leave , so i told her my review would reflect my experience and i would be relaying the experience in every local mommy group , " she added . later the same day kimberly flamm , the owner of the store in question , posted a facebook message of her own where she apologized for the incident . " i would like to publicly apologize to macy hornung for the way i handled the situation on saturday , " flamm wrote . " i ask for your forgiveness on this matter as i learn from it . my goal is to provide a warm and welcoming environment for all of my guests . " the situation continues to spark debates online , with some stating that breast - feeding is not something to be done in a public restaurant . " i personally do not want to see a mother breast - feed her child while i am trying to eat my lunch or dinner . i think she only did this to see how far she could push the envelope . i have nothing against breast - feeding but in a public restaurant is not one of them , " one person wrote . others , such as lindzey dianna , pushed back . " i ' m shocked at some of the comments on here . are people really that stupid they would get offended over a baby eating you have 360 degrees to which you can direct your vision , if a mom feeding her child offends you so much , then avert to the remaining 359 . if you ' re still overcome by the awful egregious site of a breast , then you can try eating in the bathroom or your car , " she wrote . debate over breast - feeding was stirred in christian circles last year as well , when a mother attending an elevation church campus in the ballantyne neighborhood of charlotte said that she was told to go feed her child in the ladies room , instead of the sanctuary during service . " i just got kicked out of church for breast - feeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom . shame on you elevation , " mother amanda zilliken wrote on facebook in august . elevation church released a statement after a gofundme campaign began collecting money online to help zilliken file a lawsuit . " we do not have a policy that nursing mothers can ' t be in the sanctuary , " the statement clarified . " a volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually . we are sorry that this in any way offended anyone . we welcome everyone and anyone to attend elevation church .

" the california law at issue compels pregnancy centers opposed to abortion and only those opposed to abortion to comply with burdensome requirements that force these centers to provide nonmedical information that contradicts their core message and moral beliefs , " read the brief , filed tuesday . " . . . the fact act is a viewpoint - based regulation of speech . it is therefore unconstitutional unless it can surpass strict scrutiny . tellingly , no government has ever succeeded in an attempt to justify a speech regulation that discriminates based on viewpoint . " david french , a popular conservative columnist , filed a brief monday on behalf of 41 conservative groups , arguing that the california law violated the moral conscience of pro - life activists . " the state of california directly interferes with their work by forcing them to post messages actively opposed to their lifesaving efforts , " argued french . " it is hard to imagine a greater imposition on individual conscience . it is hard to imagine a more repugnant form of forced speech . " a brief filed by groups including the national association of evangelicals , concerned women for america , the southern baptist convention ' s ethics religious liberty commission , and samaritan ' s purse called the law " viewpoint discriminatory " and that " forcing private parties to communicate the state ' s message is unjustified and unjustifiable . " in 2015 , the california passed assembly bill 775 of reproductive fact act . the law mandated that all licensed pregnancy health centers , among other things , include a sign that refers patients to abortion clinics .

subscribe to canada free press for free far be it from us to explain to the pope how the devil actually works , but . . . pope : gosh , this fake news is the work of the devil the pope who buys the media s climate change nonsense hook , line and sinker has now decided fake news is the work of the devil . well . the journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step . but as he so often does when he s dealing with matters in the civic and political realm , the pope seems a bit too deferential to established institutions on the matter of truth , objectivity and fairness . he also doesn t seem to really understand all that well how the digital world works . according to the pope , the devil wants to trick you , but all you have to do is follow the guidance of the media , education and technology establishment and you ll be fine : the tragedy of disinformation is that it discredits others , presenting them as enemies , to the point of demonizing them and fomenting conflict , the pope wrote , whereas true statements tend to promote informed and mature reflection leading to constructive dialogue . the pope portrayed latter - day makers of fake news as followers of the serpent in the garden of eden , the devil , who persuaded eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thus ushered in the tragic history of human sin . pope francis praised education and regulation to combat fake news , and encouraged tech and media companies in efforts to verify the personal identities concealed behind millions of digital profiles . but the pope laid the greatest responsibility with journalists , whom he called on to reject falsehoods , rhetorical slogans and sensational headlines in favor of a journalism of peace . there s so much wrong here , it s hard to know where to start . clearly , the pope is buying the mainstream media s default definition of fake news , which is the nonsense headlines coming from schlock web sites dressed up to look like mainstream media . there s one called abcnews . com . co , for example , that is designed to make people think they re looking at the abc news site . fake not really abc news . that s easy . but if the pope thinks that s as fake as fake gets , he s overlooking the matter of lies told by the real abc news . real media fake information . see the news can be just as fake when it s coming from real journalists . and it s more damaging when that happens because the credibility ascribed to these people - by the likes of the pope , among others - makes ordinary people assume they can believe what they re being told . maybe someone needs to sit the pope down and remind him of how satan really operates . if satan showed up at your door and handed you a pamphlet that said , jesus secretly colluded with russians to import sex slaves to miami , or claimed your heretofore unknown nigerian uncle had a multimillion - dollar fortune for you , not many people would believe him . nonsense that ham - handed is easily sniffed out , and only the most extremely gullible in our midst are influenced by it . but what the bible tells us about satan is that he s crafty . he doesn t show up with a pitchfork , devil horns and a tail ( even if the jon lovitz caricature is one of the funniest things i ve ever seen ) . satan presents himself as having credibility , knowledge , insight and wisdom . he comes off as someone who s got it together , can earn your trust and has a legitimate claim as an influencer . he seems like someone you should listen to . he seems like someone who will steer you right .

no one really wants to hear about trump s preference for activities in the bedroom . however , when details drop , we can t help ourselves . you know you don t want to hear it , you know you shouldn t want to hear it , but you have to hear it anyways especially if you know it s going to make the orange buffoon look ridiculous . with the recent revelations that trump s lawyer paid off porn star stephanie clifford , aka stormy daniels , for her silence on an extramarital affair with trump , we re now getting drips of information on what trump liked and asked her to do , and we re an equal mixture of grossed out and entertained . mother jones reported thursday that emails between daniels and political advisers for a possibly political campaign in 2009 included details about their affair . according to 2009 emails between political operatives who were at the time advising daniels on a possible political campaign , the adult film actor and director claimed that her affair with trump included an unusual act : spanking him with a copy of forbes magazine . trump likes to be spanked . let that sink in . now , one must ask : does it have to be a forbes magazine or will any old magazine do apparently , trump wanted to be spanked with a forbes magazine that had his face on the cover . yes , mother jones confirmed a cover of forbes does exist with trump on it . the cover also features son don jr . and daughter ivanka , which is beyond creepy . trump also allegedly asked her to accompany him to his hotel room to have sex when they first met but beforehand , he showed her another magazine with him on the cover . so apparently , that s the kink . magazines with trump s face on them get him off . no wonder he likes to lie about being on the cover of timE . featured image by scott olson / getty images .
as republicans continue to blast democrats in congress with accusations that dems want to shut down the government , the american people are pushing back according to new polls . according to a quinnipiac poll , 50 percent of voters want the house to be taken over by democrats . american voters say 50 39 percent they would like to see the democratic party take control of the u . s . house of representatives this year . independent voters back the democrats 45 - 37 percent . additionally , a majority of voters want to see democrats take the majority in the senate . by a similar 52 40 percent , voters want the democrats to take control of the u . s . senate this year . independent voters want democrats in control 47 37 percent . what in the world has happened in just a year , people are wanting republicans out of congress . quinnipiac found that 78 percent of those polled disapprove of the job congress is doing . of that 78 percent , 88 percent were democrats and 66 percent were republicans . republicans can thank their own failures on delivering the promises they made to their voters . one of the first orders of business was to repeal and replace obamacare , and they failed miserably . worse yet , they failed multiple times . furthermore , republicans failed to deliver a decent candidate in the alabama senate race . they gave the people of alabama such a bad candidate that alabama actually put a democrat in the senate . the only major success republicans have pulled off is passing a tax reform bill and looking at poll results , it may be too late regardless . with the possibility of a government shutdown , republicans are losing ground and democrats could actually reap the benefits in the 2018 mid - term elections . additionally only 40 percent of voters felt good about the direction america was headed . a total of 40 percent of american voters are very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the way things are going in the nation today , as 59 percent are somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied . they noted this is actually considered to be the highest level of satisfaction since a 2005 poll . however , tim malloy , the assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll noted : it has been 13 years since americans have felt this good about life in the u . s . , but the numbers suggest there is a long way to go . now , when asked who they would blame for a government shutdown , it was fairly split between republicans and democrats . thirty - two percent would blame republicans , 34 percent would blame democrats , and 21 percent would blame trump himself . on the issues , quinnipiac found 73 percent would support a daca bill to address the issue of the dreamers . out of that 73 percent , republicans were split with 49 percent supporting one and 40 percent opposing . on the issue of the ongoing investigation into russia s ties to the trump campaign , 52 percent felt it was a legitimate investigation compared to 43 percent who felt it was a witch hunt . if democrats can maintain this momentum , there stands a very good chance that control of the house and senate will shift from red to blue . however , it s far from guaranteed and there are still many months before election day . featured image by mark wilson / getty images .
when it snows , do you go out early and clear off your car or are you among the particular people who don t really finish the job be honest now . while clearing off your car may seem like a certain amount of vanity , it is really a functional issue . it helps you see better as you navigate the road . but that is not the only benefit you get from clearing your car of ice and snow . it also helps protect and lives of the other drivers on the road . in the viral video we have for you below , you will see the shocking moment a block of ice lifts off a speeding suv and smashes into the windshield of a car driving behind it . fortunately , the car that got hit has a dashboard camera running to help protect themselves from accidents like this . because they have proof that it is the other car s fault , it will be easier for them to get the insurance company to pay them for the damage . although the ice block accident happened about two years ago , it is still circulating through the internet . because climate change is causing such cold , wintry weather this year , people are eager to remember how to stay safe on the road . and the reminder that ice can fly off a person s car is a good way to recall the facts . since it was uploaded , the footage has been viewed more than three million times . and when you press play below you ll understand why its influence is so far - reaching . the victim of the ice attack was jeffrey cote . he shared the video and uploaded the following description : an ice sheet flew off the top of an suv and destroyed my windshield , bent my wiper arm , and damaged my side mirror . occurred at 8 : 45 am 12 / 30 / 15 on i - 495 s at mile 112 . 8 car : 2003 saab 9 - 5 aero wagon , cote wrote with complete accuracy . he wanted the situation to be documented correctly . if i had braked harder , i could have avoided impact , but it initially appeared the piece was going to fall in front of me . when it was all said and done , the ice caused a lot of damage to his vehicle , damage that would require the car to be out of commission while it got fixed . and it happened because the suv driver was too lazy to clean their vehicle correctly . because cote saw it coming , he wishes that he had avoided it better . but hindsight is always 20 - 20 , as the saying goes . this dashcam video shows what can go wrong if you re lazy and you don t clear that huge block of snow and ice off of the roof of your car it can fly off and crush the car behind you . now that you have seen the damage that flying ice can cause make sure you go out and clean your car of ice and snow next time you re hit with a storm this winter . think of the other drivers , and you ll help make the roads safer for all of us .
martina big , a 28 - year - old white german model , has turned herself black through a series of chemical injections and a mega - watt tanning bed . the model , who boasts her giant breast size via implants of size 32 s , has spent more than 50 , 000 to become exotic barbie , with skin that she describes as dark , crispy brown . chemical injections of melanotan into her skin help her get that dramatic dark color . she started this transformation in 2012 , opting for implants because she didn t think she was curvy enough and hoping to darken her skin , as she explained the goal : darker and darker and see what the limits are . martina is a fan of her skin color , saying , i love the contrast of my bright blonde hair and my dark , crispy brown skin . i love seeing the reactions of people . i can see their big eyes when i walk past and their shocked faces , thinking how is this possible ' she further explained , yes , i have the skin of an african girl , but i am not pretending to be a black girl . i m going to create a unique and exotic barbie with dark tan , bright blonde hair and exaggerated curves . i like this look . of the reaction she gets , she says that people don t understand because they have never seen a white girl change her skin to african dark before . once they get a better understanding , she says they tell her to go darker with the tone . and her boyfriend , michael , fully supports her , as he added : i hope for the future that martina will continue inflating her breasts , inflating her lips , getting more tanned and getting big butt implants . those are definitely some goals . michael has gotten the tanning injections as well , taking a page from his girlfriend , as he explained : i didn t want to go quite as dark as martina but i support her and like her new look very much . i am the boyfriend of the woman with the largest breasts in europe . while melanotan is not approved by the Fda , it is available from online retailers . with the tanning bed exposure , the centers for disease control and prevention explain that indoor tanning can cause skin cancers including melanoma ( the deadliest type of skin cancer ) , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma as well as cataracts and cancers of the eye ( ocular melanoma ) . those who commented on the maury show video about martina had plenty to say , including one person who noted : i m a black female and i think its cool that she appreciates dark skin . she expressed wanting to learn more about the culture . she didnt come out acting ghetto or talking in an offensive way . however , another person responded : it s not cool . it s apparent to just about most people , that this woman has mental health issues . she went from trying to look like pamela anderson to trying to look like a black woman . her breast size is absurd and the doctor who did that should be disciplined . what she is doing to her body is damaging and she is going to wind up as much a physical mess and she is a mental mess .
sushi is a trendy dish . it comes from japan , and its two main ingredients are raw fish and rice . but if you eat too much sushi , you could end up like this poor california man . because he enjoyed the japanese delicacy every day , he had a five - foot - long tapeworm come wriggling out of his body . and it left him rethinking his urge to eat so much sushi . the man , who lives in fresno , california , rushed to the emergency room because he was suffering from horrible diarrhea . and when he saw dr . kenny bahn at the emergency room , the doctor took notes , because he was planning on telling the patient s story on his podcast called this won t hurt a bit . when the california man came into the fresno community regional medical center , he told the doctors , i really want to be treated for worms . dr . bahn thought the man was crazy . but when he took a closer look , he saw that the sushi eater was horribly infected . the disgusting proof could not be denied when dr . bahn helped pull the five - foot worm out of the man s body . i take out a toilet paper roll , and wrapped around it , of course , is what looks like this giant , long tapeworm , bahn said on his tell - all podcast . when the doctor unraveled the tapeworm , it was 5 - and - a - half - feet long . that s taller than most women in the united states . that s a huge thing having suck the life out of you from the inside . the patient told bahn that the worm felt like it was wriggling out of him . and it hurt so badly that it felt like his guts were coming out . dr . bahn decided to take the man s story of suffering and share it on his audio podcast to impress his listeners . when the man sat on the toilet to push the worm out of him , it did not work . he then reached behind and started to pull on it . and when he did , the tapeworm began to resist . it did not want to leave the warm habitat of the man s bowels . it wanted to remain in there , steal his life away from him , and reproduce . when the man learned that it was only a tapeworm , he was flooded with relief . because those are treatable , he did not have to worry about some other kind of lasting health problem . and if there were any more worms in his body , he was given medication that should help remove them in due time . according to a study published by the centers for disease control and prevention last year , wild - caught salmon caught in the waters off alaska could contain worms . and because this man was eating raw salmon in his sushi , he was unknowingly putting his body at risk . if he had known , he would have changed his eating habits . the patient confirmed that he will stay away from sushi for some time yet . are you a lover of sushi will you think twice about indulging in this japanese delicacy after hearing about this worm problem

( facebook / support kountze kids faith ) a texas public school district is hoping the state supreme court will rule that high school cheerleaders don ' t have the constitutional right to include bible verses on banners displayed at football games . kountze independent school district filed a petition with the texas supreme court on wednesday after the texas court of appeals in beaumont ruled last year that the school district does not reserve the right to ban cheerleaders from including christian messages on large colorful banners that the school football team runs through before the start of games . the lower court ruled in september that the cheerleaders ' signs constituted private speech , not government speech . the school district ' s appeal for rehearing was subsequently denied by the beaumont court . attorneys for the school district have argued that the lower court ' s ruling goes against previous federal court precedents , such as the u . s . fifth circuit court ' s ruling in 2011 in the case of a cheerleader at silsbee high school who refused to cheer for an athlete who she accused of sexually assaulting her . the court reasoned in that case that cheerleaders acted as a " mouthpiece through which [ the school district ] could disseminate speech namely , support for its athletic teams . " " in federal court , a cheerleader who cheers at a game engages in government speech , but in state court , she engages in private speech , " lawyer thomas brandt wrote in the appeal , according to the beaumont enterprise . " this creates confusion for all texas school districts , " he said , adding that the banners " were held by public school cheerleaders while they were cheering for the school ' s football team , while they were in uniform at a school - sponsored event , and while they were on the school ' s football field to which access was limited by the school . " the first liberty institute , a religious freedom law group that is defending the cheerleaders , decried the school district ' s appeal . " the court of appeals correctly ruled that the kountze cheerleaders have a right to have religious speech on their run - through banners banners on which the cheerleaders painted messages they chose , with paint they paid for , on paper they purchased . why is the school district continuing to fight against this decision and the cheerleaders " first liberty institute lawyer hiram sasser said in a statement shared with the christian post . " when will the school district stop filing appeal after appeal and finally accept that the cheerleaders are free to have religious speech on their run through banners " he questioned . " hopefully the texas supreme court will not even require the cheerleaders to respond and thus bring an end to the school district ' s scorched earth litigation tactics against the kountze cheerleaders . enough is enough . " the case dates back to 2012 when the freedom from religion foundation , a national organization that advocates for strict adherence to separation of church and state , complained that religious messages on the run - through banners constituted a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment . according to the beaumont enterprise , the school district ' s attorneys also argue that the case is now moot because all of the original cheerleaders involved in the case have since graduated or are no longer a part of the team . however , david starnes , a lawyer who also represented the girls in the case , argues that the case is not moot because the mother of one of the students who didn ' t make the team in 2017 filed a grievance after her daughter didn ' t make the team . the mother claimed that her daughter didn ' t make the team in retaliation for suing the school district , according to the beaumont enterprise . " it is remarkable that the lawyers for the kountze school district are making the same , worn - out , rejected arguments , yet again , " starnes said in a statement to kfdM / fox 4 . " enough is enough . they are fully aware that the u . s . supreme court ruled in 1969 that ' it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . ' " " of course the ninth court of appeals simply followed the law and ruled in their favor , " starnes continued . " it is inexplicable that the district ' s lawyers continue trying to suppress the cheerleaders ' constitutionally - protected religious speech , when the well - reasoned opinion of the ninth court of appeals simply follows the u . s . supreme court law written in 1969 . to do otherwise , would lead to an absurd result .

concentration camps for african migrants blocked from entering europe are popping up across libya the europeans want to move their southern border from the northern edge of the mediterranean sea to the southern rim of the sahara desert . refugees do not show up in the mediterranean sea as if from nowhere . by the time they get into their flimsy boats on the libyan coastline , they have lived many , many dangerous lives . they would have left their increasingly unproductive fields in western and eastern africa , fled wars in the horn of africa , in sudan and in places as far as afghanistan , and traveled great distances to get to what they see as the final leg of their journey . what they want is to make it to europe , which since the early days of colonialism has broadcast itself as the land of milk and honey . old colonial ideas and the wealth of europe built from colonial labor beckons . it is a siren for the wretched of the earth . it has ended for many africans in virtual concentration camps in libya , where refugees that europe does not want now linger some sold into slavery . to get to libya , the migrants and refugees have to cross the sahara desert , which in arabic is known , rightly , as the greatest desert ( al - sahara al - kubra ) . it is vast , hot and dangerous . old salt caravans the azalai mostly managed by the tuareg peoples , would run between mali as well as niger and libya . they would carry gold , salt , weapons and captured human beings as objects of trade . those old caravans still make their journey , moving from one water source to the next , the camels as exhausted as the tuareg . newer caravans have supplanted these older ones . camels are not their mode of transport . they prefer buses , pickup trucks and jeeps to ferry humans and cocaine towards europe , while guns and money comes southwards . these newer caravans drive along unmarked paths , heading between sand dunes , searching for old tire tracks that have been buried in disorienting sandstorms . surviving the sand the sahara is dangerous . the journey in a pickup truck could take three days , at best , or the refugees and cocaine mules could find themselves dying from dehydration , extremists , smugglers or the security forces in the region . there are many people ready to prey on the travellers and on the smugglers , whose cars are routinely stolen . no proper account exists of dead refugees . this past june , the un refugees agency reported the death of 44 migrants who died of dehydration and heat stroke when their truck broke down between the nigerien cities of agadez and dirkou . the un had saved at least 600 migrants between april and june . saving lives in the desert is becoming more urgent than ever , said giuseppe loprete , the niger chief of mission for the international organisation for migration . to prevent migrants from reaching the mediterranean , france has asked five african countries ( burkina faso , chad , mali , mauritania and niger ) to join its g5 sahel initiative . the sahel is the belt that runs across africa below the sahara desert . the european union has also contributed to this project . the europeans want to move their southern border from the northern edge of the mediterranean sea to the southern rim of the sahara desert . french military bases run across the sahel , as the united states builds an enormous base in agadez ( niger ) from where it will fly drones to provide aerial support . the military has arrived in the sahel to stop the flow of migrants . cocaine trail agadez , where the united states military is spending 100 million to build its drone base , sits at the crossroads of our contemporary crises . refugees come to it in desperation , their land made miserable by trade policies that discriminate against small farmers and by desertification caused by carbon capitalism . as the united states government has made it difficult for cocaine to enter the u . s . from central america , the cocaine mafia have moved its operations to this central belt of africa . a leading politician in niger , cherif ould abidine , who died in 2016 , was known as mr . cocaine . billions of dollars of cocaine now moves through the sahel into the sahara and upwards to europe . the pickup trucks that carry refugees and cocaine go past the town of arlit , where french multinational corporations are harvesting uranium ( oxfam noted in 2013 , one of every three light bulbs in france is lit , thanks to nigerien uranium ) . so here we have it : refugees , cocaine , uranium and a massive military enterprise . men from gambia and from mali wait outside a smugglers compound . his toyota hilux , the camel of this new trade , sits near the gate . the men are wearing sunglasses . this is their defense once they enter the desert . they are apprehensive . their future , however grim , must be better than their present . these are gamblers . they are willing to take the chance . the engine fires up . they throw their modest belonging onto the truck . it is time for their azalai . vijay prashad is the chief editor of leftword books ( leftword . com ) and the director of tricontinental : institute for social research . he is the author of red star over the third world ( leftword , 2017 ) and the death of the nation and the future of the arab revolution ( university of california press , 2016 ) , among other books . this article previously appeared in alternet .
puerto rico homeowners brace for another disaster : foreclosures maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes . lenders to puerto rican homeowners have kicked foreclosures into high gear in the aftermath of hurricane maria , skirting local and federal borrower protections . according to attorneys and experts , lenders have ignored federal moratoria on foreclosures ; placed notices of default in newspapers where they re unlikely to be seen ; sent files to homeowners in english rather than spanish ; and required residents to complete tasks that are borderline impossible without electrical power yet fully restored , among other abuses . the foreclosure horrors add to puerto rico s dickensian experience of late . close to 35 percent of the island remains without power after hurricane maria , with full restoration not expected until may . at least 100 , 000 people have left the island . abandoned pets are everywhere . government services have been slashed or hobbled . even one major proposed solution , wiping out puerto rico s debt , will take a personal cost : the bonds represent the life savings of many residents to whom the financial products were aggressively marketed without explanation of the downsides . the economy of the island could collapse , as the republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports . ultimately , the expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard - hit areas in the u . s . mainland during the great recession . according to the new york times , roughly one - third of 425 , 000 puerto rican homeowners have fallen behind on mortgage payments , and with jobs scarce after the hurricane , that number will likely grow . in fact , the economy of the island could collapse , as the republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports a category that includes puerto rican manufacturing . but if you think america learned lessons from the orgy of illegality that accompanied foreclosures in the united states after 2008 , just look to puerto rico . despite new rules to prevent foreclosure fraud , puerto rico appears to be exhibit a in its continuation and it s only just beginning . foreclosures ravaged puerto rico even before maria , up 130 percent in 2016 relative to a decade before . adding two hurricanes to the equation makes the island s residents ripe for a gargantuan ripoff . the foreclosure process in puerto rico resembles the judicial foreclosure process on the mainland . lenders must follow federal guidelines on notifying borrowers of default and giving them an opportunity to cure debt . then lenders can file a lawsuit for foreclosure . judges are obligated to impose mandatory mediation , bringing borrowers and lenders to the table to work out a resolution . only if that doesn t work can lenders obtain a judgment and evict the homeowner . the expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard - hit areas in the u . s . mainland during the great recession . however , what sound like substantive protections for the borrower often don t play out that way . many times they don t know about their rights , said veronica rivera , a coordinator for derecho a tu casa or right to your house a coalition of legal aid groups providing information and assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure . they think that the bank would understand that they can t pay because they lost their jobs . it surprises me sometimes how much trust people have in the banks . for example , after hurricane maria , the federal government imposed a foreclosure moratorium on homes either backed by government - sponsored mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac , or those with federal housing administration insurance . the fha moratorium was recently extended to march 19 , 2018 , but it only applies to a sliver of loans . the fannie and freddie moratoria were set to expire on december 31 , but the lenders made an extension until march 31 . banks and mortgage investors voluntarily offered three months of relief from payments , but homeowners had to call their lender to trigger it . the banks said you have to call , said rivera . we didn t have internet for more than a month , didn t have electricity , no communication . many didn t know . indeed , a report from the public interest firm hedge clippers shows that one company , roosevelt cayman asset co . , has 289 active foreclosure cases in federal court and another 56 in local puerto rican courts . federal courts , typically not a venue for foreclosure cases , are seen as faster than local courts , so offshore companies like roosevelt lean heavily on them . they think that the bank would understand that they can t pay because they lost their jobs . even after the hurricane , roosevelt has filed motions for default judgment or eviction in the cases . the intercept has reviewed lists of dozens of these motions . for example , roosevelt filed a motion for eviction of ernesto santiago - guzman and his family on october 11 , three weeks after maria hit , and a motion for default judgment against elias rivera - rivera on october 12 . u . s . district judge gustavo gelp denied that request because the case was only initiated a month before the hurricanes , which trashed the entire island of puerto rico . the judge postponed the case until march . other judges have not been so kind . docket entries show that roosevelt secured a default judgment against carlos gonzalez - luna s property on october 23 . many of the loans roosevelt acted on were purchased in a fire sale from the federal deposit insurance corporation after the 2015 failure of doral bank , a lender with a large portfolio of puerto rican mortgages . these loans were severely delinquent , some over two years . federally insured distressed mortgages in puerto rico have become an appetizing target for wall street land speculators seeking to make a quick buck and turn puerto rico into a playground for the rich . an unidentified puerto rico homeowner submitted a comment to the consumer financial protection bureau s consumer complaint database , claiming that roosevelt is not flexible and expressed that they just want to acquire the home to build their house portfolio . federally insured distressed mortgages in puerto rico have become an appetizing target for wall street land speculators . critics allege roosevelt uses sleazy tactics to get default judgments . since the hurricane , they ve sought to use service by publication , publishing names in the newspaper to serve the lawsuits . who s reading the newspaper these days asked jim baker , founder of the private equity stakeholder project , who helped with the hedge clippers report . then they ask for default judgment because they served papers and the homeowners haven t responded . in most cases , they re getting [ the judgment ] , he added , referring to roosevelt . roosevelt is an affiliate of rushmore loan management services , which in turn services loans owned by private equity giant tpg capital , managers of 73 billion in assets . while tpg spokesperson patrick clifford claims only a client relationship between rushmore and tpg , rushmore s principal owners are senior tpg executives . a june 2017 report lists rushmore as the second - largest repossessor on the island , behind only banco popular , puerto rico s main bank . ( a new tpg impact investing fund includes on its board pierre omidyar , founder of first look media , the intercept s parent company . ) activist groups held protests outside tpg headquarters in manhattan , calling for an end to foreclosures on the island . related demonstrations were held in eight cities around the world . this is the first of many companies hurting the people of puerto rico and it will be one of many we will be scrutinizing , said julio l pez varona , a spokesperson for hedge clippers , in a statement . we have asked tpg and rushmore directly to stop their foreclosures and we will continue to target them until they stop harming puerto ricans . this appears to have made an impact . rushmore claims to have instituted an immediate suspension of foreclosure proceedings in puerto rico , per spokesperson steven goldberg , including stopping notice by publication . the length of the freeze is indefinite . the foreclosure moratorium expires december 31 for loans backed by fannie mae and freddie mac , and by march for fha - insured loans . rushmore pursues loan modification or other alternatives to foreclosure first in all cases and remains fully committed to working to keep as many borrowers as possible in their homes , goldberg said , especially in light of the extremely challenging circumstances caused by the hurricane . he said the company has conducted extensive outreach efforts to contact borrowers , given communication problems on the island . goldberg even provided the number to rushmore s puerto rico office , ( 877 ) 509 - 8389 , and its spanish and english websites , urging borrowers to contact them to seek a resolution to their situations . tpg s clifford added , we ve been in constructive dialogue with various advocacy groups , and we plan to continue having those conversations because they are important . even if homeowners were lucky or savvy enough to fall under the foreclosure moratorium , it expires december 31 for loans backed by fannie mae and freddie mac , and by march for fha - insured loans . many have called for those to be extended , but no decision has been made . the voluntary payment moratoria also expire by january . in an opinion piece for puerto rican newspaper el nuevo dia , ricardo j . ramos gonz lez , who runs the legal aid clinic at the university of puerto rico s school of law , warned residents that the payment moratorium merely comprised forbearance , not a cancellation of payments . those who accepted the moratorium on payments , could very well face a process of collection and eventual foreclosure of their main home , if they are required to pay three months plus the current term , gonz lez wrote . he endorsed a yearlong moratorium on foreclosures , similar to those instituted in some states during the great depression . when foreclosure notices and letters from lenders come in the mail in puerto rico , they are typically in english . but many puerto ricans only speak spanish . unlike in local courts , federal court filings are similarly in english , putting homeowners at a disadvantage . foreclosure notices and letters from lenders are typically in english , but many puerto ricans only speak spanish . rivera of derecho a tu casa claims that lenders have been negotiating loss mitigation with borrowers while also pursuing foreclosure , a scheme known as dual tracking , which is supposed to be illegal under federal mortgage servicing laws and local law in puerto rico . the mediation process has not assisted borrowers more generally . lawyers cannot participate in the process unless the client gives us special power , said rivera . worse , lenders send representatives who are not empowered to make decisions , she explained . it s a pro forma process , said rivera . the banks do not have to give a specific option . foreclosure lawyers in puerto rico are also finding the same discrepancies in foreclosure processing that roiled the united states after the crisis . this is not surprising , since those errors never really stopped in the united states . rivera alleges that investors who came in and scooped up distressed mortgages didn t follow property records procedures . there have been cases where there is no mortgage . they don t have the note , rivera said . the endgame of aggressively foreclosing on properties in puerto rico where there is little hope of turning them around to make a profit is unclear . offshore lenders made this investment a couple years ago , said baker of private equity stakeholder project . they re churning through the portfolio . maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes . the insurance payouts also benefit offshore purchasers of distressed mortgages ; that alone could turn a profit relative to the small price paid . derecho a tu casa offers resources at its website to educate homeowners and also representation for those who qualify . many people get depressed and we want to give them hope , rivera said . i can see the difference when i represent someone . this article previously appeared in the intercept
congolese president attacks peaceful new year s eve protestors while the rest of the world celebrates their hopes for the new year , the congolese suffer repression and death . while the black agenda report took a week off for the holidays , ugandan president yoweri museveni ordered his army to attack b ni territory in the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) two days before christmas . then , on new year ' s eve , congolese president joseph kabila ordered his military police to attack congolese peacefully protesting his refusal to relinquish power despite the expiration of his term in office at the end of december 2016 . as of january 2 , the death toll among the protesters had risen to 12 , more had been wounded , and at least 120 had been arrested . i spoke to boniface musavuli , a native of b ni territory , political exile in france , and author of les massacres de b ni and genocide of the congolese - - from leopold ii to paul kagame . ann garrison : boniface , the congolese never seem to get a break , not even for the holidays , do they boniface musavuli : yes , that ' s the case . while the rest of the world celebrates the holiday season and their hopes for the new year , the congolese suffer repression and death . the end of year period is not chosen at random . most violent events in congo occur between november and january . ag : i ve noted that too . can you explain why bm : this period corresponds either to the great moment of international news dominated by the united states ( presidential campaign and then transfer of power ) , or to the end - of - year celebrations . there is not a lot of media that can cover both the us presidential campaign , end - of - year celebrations , and events in an african country . in january 1961 , lumumba was assassinated during the transfer of power between eisenhower and john kennedy . in 1996 - 1997 , the congo was attacked by rwanda and uganda during the campaign for the re - election of bill clinton . in january 2001 , president laurent - desire kabila was assassinated during the passing of power between bill clinton and george bush . at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 , rwanda and uganda attacked congo for the third time during the obama campaign and transfer of power . troops led by rwandan officers are attacking the people of b ni to get them out of the way of their resource trafficking networks and territorial ambitions . ag : we spoke a week ago when the uganda people ' s defense force ( updf ) announced that its attack aircraft had entered congolese air space to bomb camps of the allied democratic forces ( adf ) and that it was shelling the same camps with long range weapons from across the border . the updf then announced that they had killed 100 adf fighters . shouldn ' t that have been the end of the adf , which the un group of experts on drc said had been reduced to 100 members by 2015 boniface musavuli : the information published by the ugandan army on the losses suffered by " alleged adf " has not been confirmed from local sources . one must always doubt the information given by a force engaged in a conflict . ann garrison : if the bombing and shelling is not hitting adf militia members , who is it hitting there have been a few reports of refugees crossing the congolese border into uganda , but no casualty reports that i can find . bm : i think that the main objective of the ugandan army is not to fight on congolese soil , but rather to occupy . as i have previously explained , the " adf " no longer exists as a military force and the " alleged adf " are instead the excuse of some troops led by rwandan officers who have infiltrated the congolese army . they are attacking the people of b ni to get them out of the way of their resource trafficking networks and territorial ambitions . uganda can not fight against an enemy that no longer exists . on the other hand , uganda has interests in eastern congo and wants to protect them before the end of joseph kabila ' s reign . the main objective of the ugandan army is not to fight on congolese soil , but rather to occupy . ag : uganda ' s new vision seems to be the only ugandan publication to have published a critical report updf on the spot over dr congo mission and they quoted your remarks in our conversation extensively . an online publication called actualit cd quoted juma balikwisha , b ni ' s member of congo s parliament , who , like you , accused the ugandan army of coming to occupy , and said that ugandan troops were on congolese soil before the attack . they also quoted thomasa d ' awuin muti , the president of north kivu province civil society , who said [ translation from french ] : " until today , we know that the neighbors destabilizing our country are rwanda and uganda . and so , using the destabilizers to stabilize is less thoughtful . when we went to the military authorities , they told us that they were not yet informed on a plan developed between the congolese and ugandan army and that they were surprised to learn that the ugandan army is conducting bombing operations . you understand that there is not even planning between the fardc [ congolese army ] and the updf [ ugandan army ] . " we know that the neighbors destabilizing our country are rwanda and uganda . this is one of many contradictory reports as to whether or not the congolese and ugandan armies have been working together against the alleged adf in beni , but maybe we shouldn ' t expect consistency since they claim to be attacking a ghost militia in the first place . can you help us make any sense of this bm : in reality , uganda has always held the congolese army in low regard . the congo under kabila could not create an army powerful enough to stop its aggressors from the east , rwanda , uganda , and burundi since 1996 . the armies of these three countries , and even of angola on congo s southwest border , are accustomed to penetrating congolese national territory and then leaving without being bothered by the congolese government . however , my information is that the ugandan army has not yet engaged troops on the ground , and that they continue instead to amass at the border . ag : ok , let ' s turn to kabila ' s new year ' s eve attacks on the peaceful marchers protesting his refusal to relinquish power on new year s eve . on december 30 , reuters reported that kabila had ordered telecommunications companies to cut internet and sms text messaging services across the country ahead of planned anti - government demonstrations . how were you able to learn about what happened next in france bm : communication services have indeed been cut . what is deplorable is that the minister who ordered the cuts , mr . emery okundji , is a former active member of the opposition who joined kabila . at the time he was in opposition , he was hostile to the practice of cutting off communications for political reasons . kabila is discrediting the entire congolese political class . we still managed to call our contacts on the ground . kabila is discrediting the entire congolese political class . ag : the catholic church , which called for the peaceful new year ' s eve protests , is the second most powerful institution in drc , isn ' t it second only to the army bm : the catholic church is not a political or state institution . it can not be compared to the police or the army , which are state institutions . the catholic church is , however , the most respected and well - established civilian institution in the country . catholicism is congo ' s first religion with 50 of believers . during the new year s eve march , many priests showed extraordinary courage by walking in the front line with the people . ag : and what is the church calling on kabila to do are they backing an interim president until elections can be organized bm : the catholic church had sponsored a political agreement in december 2016 between kabila and the opposition to allow kabila , whose constitutional mandate had expired , to be able to organize the elections in 2017 . kabila did not respect this agreement , and everything suggests that he will never hold elections . the catholic church is fighting for a transitional government without kabila . ag : and what would you like to see happen bm : the idea of a transition without kabila is the most logical . kabila did not organize elections because he has no intention of leaving power . however , for this idea to be implemented , kabila must somehow be removed from power . until then the nation is at a dead end . ag : will anything decisive happen without the agreement of the united nations security council ( unsc ) and / or the us bm : in fact , one of the keys to the crisis lies in the hands of the united nations , and especially the united states . kabila and his entourage must be subjected to international sanctions until they agree to withdraw from power . ag : and where do the unsc and the us seem to stand now bm : americans , french and several african countries have not yet agreed on the need to get rid of kabila quickly . the emissary of president donald trump , un ambassador nikki haley , asked the kabila regime to organize the elections that it failed to organize in 2017 in 2018 . an electoral calendar was published providing for elections on december 23 , 2018 . but this date is likely to be ignored just as the december 2017 date was . and even if elections were held on that date , they would be so discredited by fraud that their results would give rise to massive challenges and a new crisis of legitimacy . kabila must somehow be removed from power . until then the nation is at a dead end . ag : is there anything else you ' d like to say bm : congo is in a situation that requires a strong mobilization of the international community . kabila and his followers are only concerned about one thing : to retain power . meanwhile , social distress keeps worsening and the security situation keeps deteriorating . if nothing is done quickly , the crisis will only get further out of control . ann garrison is an independent journalist based in the san francisco bay area . in 2014 , she received the victoire ingabire umuhoza democracy and peace prize for her reporting on conflict in the african great lakes region . she can be reached at anngarrison or [ email protected ] . boniface musavuli is a native of beni territory now living in political exile in france and author of the books the massacres of beni and the genocides of the congolese , from leopold ii to paul kagame . he can be reached at [ email protected ] .

settler colonialism and the second amendment the violent appropriation of native land by white settlers was seen as an individual right in the second amendment of the u . s . constitution , second only to freedom of speech . the anglo - american settlers violent break from britain in the late eighteenth century paralleled their search - and - destroy annihilation of delaware , cherokee , muskogee , seneca , mohawk , shawnee , and miami , during which they slaughtered families without distinction of age or gender , and expanded the boundaries of the thirteen colonies into unceded native territories . the declaration of independence of 1776 symbolizes the beginning of the indian wars and westward movement that continued across the continent for another century of unrelenting u . s . wars of conquest . that was the goal of independence , with both the seasoned indian killers of the revolutionary army and white settler - rangers / militias using extreme violence against indigenous noncombatants with the goal of total domination . these forces were met with resistance movements and confederations identified with leaders such as buckongeahelas of the delaware ; alexander mcgillivray of the muskogee - creek ; little turtle and blue jacket of the miami - shawnee alliance ; joseph brant of the mohawk ; and cornplanter of the seneca ; as well as the great tecumseh and the shawnee - led confederation in the ohio valley . without their sustained resistance , the intended genocide would have been complete ; the eastern half of the continent was ethnically cleansed of native nations by 1850 , through forced relocation to indian territory west of the mississippi . without the indigenous people s sustained resistance , the intended genocide would have been complete . the program of expansion and the wars against native american civilization and the agricultural societies of the vast valley of the ohio river and the great lakes region began before the declaration with the french and indian war of 1754 63 , which was the north american extension of the seven years war between france and britain in europe . britain s victory over france in 1763 led to its domination of world trade , sea power , and colonial holdings for nearly two centuries . in the treaty of paris , france ceded canada and all claims east of the mississippi to britain . in the course of that war , anglo - american settlers intensified their use of counterinsurgent violence , which the anglo settler elite dubbed savage wars , against indigenous peoples resistance to their incursions into the territories of the ottawa , miami , kickapoo , and the confederations identified with pontiac s leadership of the great lakes region , spreading to the illinois and ohio countries . by the end of the war , significant numbers of anglo settlers had taken indigenous lands beyond the colonies boundaries , and land speculation was a road to riches for a fortunate few . to the settlers dismay , soon after the 1763 treaty of paris was signed , king george iii issued a proclamation prohibiting british settlement west of the allegheny - appalachian mountain chain , ordering those who had settled there to relinquish their claims and return to the kingdom s thirteen colonies . soon it became clear that the british authorities needed far more soldiers to enforce the edict , as thousands of settlers ignored it and continued to pour over the mountains , squatting on indigenous lands , forming armed militias , and provoking indigenous resistance . in 1765 , in order to enforce the proclamation line , the british parliament imposed the stamp act on the colonists , a tax on all printed materials that had to be paid in british pounds , not local paper money . the iconic colonial protest slogan taxation without representation is tyranny marked the surge of rebellion against british control , but it did not tell the whole story , considering what the tax was for : to pay the cost of housing , feeding , and transporting soldiers to contain and suppress the colonies from expanding further into indian territory . the complaints iterated in the declaration largely focus on the measures used by king george to prevent his rebellious subjects from grabbing more land : [ king george ] has excited domestic insurrections [ slave revolts ] amongst us , and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless indian savages [ indigenous nations resisting genocidal wars ] , whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction , of all ages , sexes and conditions . thousands of settlers continued to pour over the mountains , squatting on indigenous lands . by the early 1770 s , terrorism waged by anglo - american settlers against even christianized native communities within the colonies and violent encroachment on those outside the colonial boundaries raged , and illegal speculation in stolen indian lands was rampant . in the southern colonies especially , farmers who had lost their land in competition with larger , more efficient , slave - worked plantations rushed for native farmlands over the mountain range . these militant settlers rangers thus created the framework for the united states to appropriate native territories and attempt to eradicate indigenous nations across the continent for the following century . illegal squatter - settlers , always with practiced indian killers in the lead , initially depended on colonial militias for support ; after the war of independence they relied on the u . s . military to protect their settlements . during the war years of 1774 83 , the secessionists parallel wars against native nations were , in military historian john grenier s words , waypoints in the development of the first way of war . in them , we find the same elements necessity and efficiency , the uncontrollable momentum of extravagant violence , and the quest for the subjugation of indians that had defined the first way of war throughout the colonial period . in a book first published in 1876 but written decades earlier , historian joseph doddridge ( 1769 1826 ) , a minister and early settler in the ohio country , wrote : the early settlers on the frontiers of this country were like arabs of the desert of africa , in at least two respects ; every man was a soldier , and from early in the spring till late in the fall , was almost continually in arms . their work was often carried on by parties , each one of whom had his rifle and everything else belonging to his wardress . these were deposited in some central place in the field . a sentinel was stationed on the outside of the fence , so that on the least alarm the whole company repaired to their arms , and were ready for combat in a moment . militant settlers rangers created the framework for the united states to appropriate native territories and attempt to eradicate indigenous nations across the continent . the second amendment thus reflects this dependence on individual armed men , not just in terms of a right to bear arms , but also as a requirement to bear arms , which was crucial to the integrity of the state and the conception of security achieved through a relationship between state and citizen . in 1783 , the british withdrew from the fight to maintain sovereignty over their thirteen colonies , not due to military defeat , but rather in order to redirect their resources to occupy and colonize south asia . britain s transfer of its claim to indian country west of the colonies spelled a nightmarish disaster for all indigenous peoples east of the mississippi , and ultimately all of north america that would be claimed and occupied by the united states . britain s withdrawal in 1783 opened a new chapter of unrestrained racist violence and colonization of the continent . the creation of the u . s . constitution began in 1785 , but the document was not approved by all the states and in effect until 1791 . meanwhile , the interim continental congress got to work on a plan for colonization over the mountain range . the land ordinance of 1785 established a centralized system for surveying and distributing land , with seized native lands being auctioned off to the highest bidder . the northwest ( referring to the ohio country ) ordinance of 1787 set forth a colonization procedure for annexation via military occupation , transforming to civilian territorial status under federal control , and , finally , statehood . these were the first laws of the incipient republic , revealing the motive for those desiring independence . it was the blueprint for the taking of the north american continent , with lines of future settlement reaching the pacific on the maps . the maps contained in the land ordinances , which laid out land in marketable square - mile plots , were not new ; they were the products of pre - revolutionary colonial elites , including george washington , who as leader of the virginia militia took armed surveying teams illegally into ohio country , making him one of the most successful land speculators in the colonies . the wealthiest colonists were all speculators ; acquiring land and enslaving people provided the very basis of the economy of the first nation born as a capitalist state , and by 1850 , it was the wealthiest economy in the world . in 1801 , president thomas jefferson aptly described the new settler - state s intentions for horizontal and vertical continental expansion as an empire for liberty , stating : however our present interests may restrain us within our own limits , it is impossible not to look forward to distant times , when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits and cover the whole northern , if not the southern continent , with a people speaking the same language , governed in similar form by similar laws . this vision of manifest destiny found form a few years later in the monroe doctrine , signaling the intention of annexing or dominating former spanish colonial territories in the americas and the pacific , which would be put into practice during the rest of the century , while carrying out brutal wars of extermination and expulsion of native peoples to complete the continental shape of the united states today . britain s transfer of its claim to indian country west of the colonies spelled a nightmarish disaster for all indigenous peoples east of the mississippi , and ultimately all of north america . taking land by force was not an accidental or spontaneous project or the work of a few rogue characters . the violent appropriation of native land by white settlers was seen as an individual right in the second amendment of the u . s . constitution , second only to freedom of speech . male colonial settlers had long formed militias for the purpose of raiding and razing indigenous communities and seizing their lands and resources , and the native communities fought back . virginia , the first colony , forbade any man to travel unless he was well armed . a few years later , another law required men to take arms with them to work and to attend church or be fined . in 1658 , the colony ordered every settler home to have a functioning firearm , and later even provided government loans for those who could not afford to buy a weapon . similarly , new england colonial governments made laws such as the 1632 requirement that each person have a functioning firearm plus two pounds of gunpowder and ten pounds of bullets . householders were fined for missing or defective arms and ammunition . no man was to appear at a public meeting unarmed . 4 these laws stayed on the books of the earliest colonies and were created in new colonies as they were founded . the second amendment , ratified in 1791 , enshrined these obligations as constitutional law : a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . the continuing significance of that freedom specified in the bill of rights reveals the settler - colonialist cultural roots of the united states that appear even in the present as a sacred right . several of the colonies that declared independence in 1776 massachusetts , new hampshire , new jersey , pennsylvania , vermont , and virginia had already adopted individual gun rights measures into their state constitutions before the second amendment was passed at the federal level . settler - militias and armed households were institutionalized for the destruction and control of native peoples , communities , and nations . with the expansion of plantation agriculture , by the late 1600 s they were also used as slave patrols , forming the basis of the u . s . police culture after enslaving people was illegalized . that is the inseparable other half of the settler - colonial reality that is implicit in the second amendment . the first enslaved africans to be shipped to britain s first colony of the eventual thirteen colonies that became the united states took place in 1619 , when twenty bonded africans arrived in virginia . most of the labor being used in the first decade of the colony was made up of british and other europeans who had indentured themselves for varying lengths of time , but african slavery was different . as howard zinn points out : some historians think those first blacks in virginia were considered as servants , like the white indentured servants brought from europe . but the strong probability is that , even if they were listed as servants ( a more familiar category to the english ) , they were viewed as being different from white servants , were treated differently , and in fact were slaves . george washington took armed surveying teams illegally into ohio country , making him one of the most successful land speculators in the colonies . other scholars have presumed that the british settlers in north america were reluctant to enslave africans , but that too seems a spurious notion . when the doctrine of discovery promulgated by the vatican in the mid - fifteenth century legalized the portuguese capture and enslavement of the people of west africa , the trans - atlantic slave trade took off , first within european markets . then , in 1492 , it reached the caribbean , and had been in effect for over a century when the virginia seaboard was wrenched from the indigenous farmers by english usurpers . from the mid - fifteenth century to the mid - twentieth century , most of the non - european world was colonized under the doctrine of discovery , one of the first principles of international law promulgated by christian european monarchies to legitimize investigating , mapping , and claiming lands belonging to peoples outside europe . it originated in a papal bull issued in 1455 that permitted the portuguese monarchy to seize west africa for enslaving those who lived there . following columbus s infamous exploratory voyage in 1492 , sponsored by the king and queen of the infant spanish state , another papal bull extended similar permission to spain . disputes between the portuguese and spanish monarchies led to the papal - initiated treaty of tordesillas ( 1494 ) , which , besides dividing the globe equally between the two iberian empires , clarified that only non - christian lands fell under the discovery doctrine . this doctrine , on which all european states relied , thus originated with the arbitrary and unilateral establishment of the iberian monarchies exclusive rights under christian canon law to colonize , enslave , and exterminate foreign peoples , and these were later embraced by other european monarchical colonizing projects , such as the british in north america . the only barrier to introducing slavery in virginia and all the other colonies would have been economic , not ethical . the southern colonies emerged in territory that had been one of seven original birthplaces of agriculture in the world tens of thousands of years before , developed by the muskogee and other indigenous agricultural societies . appropriated by european settlers , these lands would become economies based on enslaved african labor and increasingly on breeding enslaved people for profit , with the indigenous farmers forced to the peripheries . at the time of u . s . independence , half the population of south carolina was made up of enslaved africans , with the other agribusiness colonies having large enslaved populations as well . by the late seventeenth century , onerous slave codes had been developed , which included mandatory slave patrols drawn from the already existing militias . new england colonial governments made laws such as the 1632 requirement that each person have a functioning firearm plus two pounds of gunpowder and ten pounds of bullets . the wealthy slavers of the southern colonies , particularly those in virginia , were most incensed by the british proclamation following the french and indian war prohibiting expansion over the appalachian ridge , since their wealth relied on accessing more and more land as they depleted the soils with intensive monocrop production for the market . they defied the proclamation , taking survey teams into the ohio country to map the territory for future settlement , which by definition meant the extension and expansion of slavery . by the time he was in his mid - twenties , george washington was already a notoriously successful slaver and land speculator in unceded indian lands . washington and the other founders of the united states designed a governmental and economic structure to serve the private property interests of each and all of the primary actors , nearly all of them slavers and land speculators , with the brilliant alexander hamilton as the genius of finance . like the indian - killing militias that continued and intensified as the united states appropriated more land for slavers , slave patrols grew accordingly . the ethnic cleansing of native americans complete , slavers with their reserve of capital and enslaved labor transformed the mississippi valley into the cotton kingdom that formed the basis for u . s . capitalism and world trade . in the words of harvard historian walter johnson : the extension of slavery into the mississippi valley gave an institution that was in decline at the end of the eighteenth century new life in the nineteenth . in 1800 , there were around 100 , 000 slaves living within the boundaries of the present - day states of mississippi and louisiana ; in 1840 , there were more than 250 , 000 ; in 1860 , more than 750 , 000 . 9 the militaristic - capitalist powerhouse that the united states became by 1840 derived from real estate ( which included enslaved africans , as well as appropriated land ) . the united states was founded as a capitalist state and an empire on conquered land , with capital in the form of slaves , hence the term chattel slavery ; this was exceptional in the world and has remained exceptional . the capitalist firearms industry was among the first successful modern corporations . gun proliferation and gun violence today are among its legacies . roxanne dunbar -

when the news broke that stephanie clifford , aka stormy daniels , had an extramarital affair with donald trump ( during melania s pregnancy ) , it was revealed she was paid 130 , 000 to keep silent . trump s lawyer michael cohen has continuously tried to blame the media and their false narrative and has consistently denied there was any sexual relationship . however , it s really hard to believe that especially when cohen attempted to pay clifford in the most shadiest of ways . the wall street journal reported that not only was clifford paid 130 , 000 , but she was paid through a company that was created shortly before election day in 2016 . the lawyer , michael cohen , established essential consultants llc , on oct . 17 , 2016 , just before the 2016 presidential election , corporate documents show . mr . cohen , who is based in new york , then used a bank account linked to the entity to send the payment to the client - trust account of a lawyer representing the woman , stephanie clifford , one of the people said . there are several things about this transaction that are curious . looking at the timing of the transaction , it s obvious it was paid at a precarious time for the trump campaign . trump s campaign had weathered several scandals including the access hollywood scandal . trump didn t need another one , so a payment of 130 , 000 from trump would make sense . now , the wall street journal notes something very important . cohen was based in new york ; however , he opened a business in delaware . why according to wsj , delaware does not require the names of managers of businesses to be disclosed . they wrote : mr . cohen s decision to establish the company in delaware offered him privacy and simplicity , hallmarks of a state that has attracted more than one million business entities . so , finding cohen s ties to the company would not be easily done . however , cohen did put himself down as an authorized person for essential consultants llc , so his name showed up on the formation documents . why would anyone pay 130 , 000 to someone through a fake company in a state that protects the identities of business owners for any other reason than a bribe to keep silent there s literally no other explanation to give . funnily enough , cohen has not said very much about the actual payment . however , he has denied there was ever any sexual relationship between trump and clifford . in emails to the journal last week , mr . cohen didn t address the 130 , 000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that president trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has ms . clifford . he also declined to discuss essential consultants , and asked the journal to cease wasting my time . cohen and the trump administration can deny the allegations until they are blue in the face . however , it s too shady of a deal . trump would never pay someone 130 , 000 just for the hell of it . he s bragged about never settling in court . he would only make such a deal if he had something important to gain from it . buying clifford s silence would be beyond important . anyone with a drop of common sense can see right through the sham they are presenting to the american people . featured image by drew angerer / getty images .
a cancer diagnosis never comes at the right time . but for children , it can be so much worse . the life - threatening illness makes children contemplate their own mortality . and while this can inspire people to seize life while they have it , it can also be very depressing . but when people step up to the challenge and do everything they can to battle cancer and win , then they can face life with a whole new kind of courage and bravery . and that s what happened to gunner miller . after cancer put this rising football star on the sidelines for two years , his father , who also happened to be the high school football coach , decided to put gunner back in the game for the first time since he started fighting cancer . and gunner was there to play the final snap of the team s championship game . ever since doctors told gunner he had ewing s sarcoma back in 2015 , he has been getting treated and was too weakened from the rare type of cancer of his bones to play football . gunner s energy was spent enduring hours of therapy and rehab throughout most of 2015 and 2016 . and as a result , gunner was not allowed to play football for those seasons . only on thursday , a few days before christmas 2017 did his father allow him to suit up and play during the high school s biggest game of the season . they were matched up against their rivals brock high school and were playing for the class 3 a division i title game . the stakes were high , and gunner wanted to win . gunner went into remission in august after he had surgery to remove a tumor . his father , who coaches the team , did not want his son in the game . but gunner s teammates demanded that he play . it wasn t even my idea . it was his teammates idea , jeff miller told the telegram following the game . they came up to me and said , hey , would you be willing to do this they didn t have to ask me twice . brock high was destroying gunner s team . they had taken a 21 - 0 lead after just one quarter . but rockdale climbed back and scored four touchdowns to go into halftime 21 - 28 . and as gunner stepped in for the final play , he helped ensure they were victorious . in the end , the rockdale tigers were crowned football state champions for the first time in four decades . gunner took a knee to win the game . we ve dealt with adversity for so long and so often that we know a football game , a football season and life are going to be rough on you sometimes , jeff miller said as he wept . with the championship won , the millers celebrated christmas with their family in texas . some mailonline readers shared their thoughts about gunner s victory . there it is . the oNLY time a player should take a knee at a football game . this is what team sports are really about . building strength of both body and character . my dad used to coach boxing , and would have been in tears too if that were me . what is your reaction to this christmas miracle
sometimes the power of christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things . you do not need to believe in the holy trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others . the simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days , as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need . one congregation in ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on christmas eve . the pastor at grand lake united methodist church in celina , ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of jesus . for many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself , to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit . the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives . jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time but what would a generous act look like in our times that was the focus of the sermon . the potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation , who were so moved they had to take action after the sermon ended , the congregation decided to take an offering . a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears . what did they do with this offering members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift . what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families the ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families . they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills . the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies , and wanted to help them out . they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house . in total that amounted to 3 , 500 being split amongst the staff . what a beautiful moment what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house . sure , they could not see their families , but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community . perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return . it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain . it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives . this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year .
one of the worst things that a mother can face , is having an ill or severely disabled child . when joellan huntley was just 15 - years - old , she was in a car accident that left her with a catastrophic brain injury . having been thrown from a car that swerved to avoid a loose dog running along a road in centreville , nova scotia , joellan suffered traumatic injuries . in that same accident , her boyfriend and a young girl who was the sister of the driver were killed . as a result of the crash , joellan s family won a 1 million settlement , however ; by 2014 the family was in a battle with the province s community services department , which was on a mission to get the money back for past and future costs of care . the result of the battle was a settlement that gave the family funds for physiotherapy and equipment that would add to joellan s quality of life . since 1996 , her mother , louise misner , hasn t been able to have the luxury of having a conversation of her daughter , and the now 37 - year - old has spent most of her life unable to walk or talk and she s been fed through a tube . while joellan was able to make sounds to respond to family members , she was unable to communicate any thoughts until now . thanks to technology equipment that she recently received , joellan is able to communicate with her mom via eye motion cameras and software on an ipad . and the best part is that all of this happened on christmas day , proving that christmas miracles really do exist for the nova scotia family . it happened when louise was visiting joellan at the kings regional rehabilitation center in waterville , nova scotia . what seems like a basic conversation between mother and daughter , turned out to be a miracle . louise had told joellan that she liked the christmas outfit that she was wearing . joellan then used the technology to find an icon for a long - sleeve shirt to respond to her mom . christmas miracle , said louise , who had been longing for this exchange for years . it was god s way of telling me that she s finally achieved what she needed to since the accident . according to joellan s nurses , she is doing well with the new communication system . we had to go through two or three different screens until we found the right one for her and it s called eyegaze , said louise . her eyes focus on the icons to answer questions . i knew she just needed time for technology to catch up with her . when god gives you a child , they are the most precious thing and you never give up on them and you always fight for them . we take for granted the simple things that most of us are able to do on a daily basis like have a conversation with a parent or a child . unfortunately , there are people who don t have that privilege . luckily technology is moving forward at a rapid pace and hopefully , life will only get easier for joellan and her family . they ve certainly been through enough already .
if you are educated in advertising then you probably know a bit about the mind games that advertisers play in order to get their customers to get hooked and become consumers of their products . advertisers are so gifted that they can even make you think that drinking alcohol is healthy and will make you more successful in both the bedroom and the office . when it comes to advertising , it s all about the image . it s for this reason that billboards across america show a sexy woman drinking a martini or a glass of wine , eluding to the fact that she booze will give her liquid courage and make her appear like she s got it all together . the same goes for those old - school cigarette commercials . remember when they made it look like you d instantly transform into a strong and healthy cowboy . considering smokers are much more likely to lose their lives to lung cancer , then these ads are far from believable . a similar trick of the eye scheme was exposed at a fast food restaurant recently , and it was all caught on camera . when one clever person realized that the unknown restaurant was selling three different sized beverages , that were essentially the same size , they decided to film it and show the world exactly how the soda fit into the small , medium and large sizes . yet , the company was selling them for three different prices , the largest one costing the most amount of money of course . in the video , you can see that the three cups are all shaped different , yet they give the appearance that the large is the tallest of the three , as to be expected . but if you look closely , the largest cup has a very narrow bottom , making it appear that it is tall but it is actually very thin at the bottom . the smallest cup appears to be very similar to the medium sized cup , however ; it must be a tad wider than the medium cup in order to fit the same amount . in any event , if you are a lover of fast food , then you should beware of this type of scam . these restaurants are probably making loads of dough all because of this little trick of the eye . be smarter than them and ask to see the cups up close before you make a purchase and decide on a drink size . it may be in your best interest to always pay for a small cup , considering it s essentially the exact same size as the large for the same amount of money . or , you can really be sure and purchase yourself a bottle of soda at a nearby convenience store . there is a good chance that restaurants are doing this type of advertising with their other products as well . maybe that super - sized meal isn t as super - sized as you thought it was . as they say . looks can be deceiving . sometimes it s best to do your homework when it comes to sizes and prices at restaurants before you fork over your hard - earned cash .
one of the most controversial aspects of the trump - russia investigation is the steele dossier and the company , fusion gps , who called for the creation of the steele dossier . republicans swear it s fake news . democrats assert it s proof that an investigation into trump s wheelings and dealings is called for . when fusion gps owner , glenn simpson , testified before the house intelligence committee , he made some serious allegations . thanks to the release of the transcript by house democrats , we re getting a look at those allegations , and they are indeed serious . sen . dianne feinstein also released the senate transcript of their interview with simpson . the most serious allegation appears to be the allegation that trump conducted several business deals that appeared to researchers as russian money laundering . rep . adam schiff ( d - ca ) asked simpson about how the russians launder money and if he found any evidence of money laundering through trump . simpson answered : i think a lot of what we found is subsequently there have been similar articles published . evidence , i think we saw patterns of buying and selling that we thought were suggestive of money laundering . simpson went on to explain that , as researchers , they notice patterns that indicate money laundering , which included the buying and selling of real estate . he then presented several facts that seem to support the allegation that russia was laundering money through trump . simpson described a russian gangster , who went by taiwanchik , who either lived in trump tower or had his associates living in trump tower . we had a gangster named taiwanchik living in trump tower who had been under i m sorry , he was i think he was running a his associates were living in trump tower , and he was running a high - stakes gambling ring out of trump tower , while he himself was a fugitive for having rigged the skating competition at the salt lake olympics and a bunch of other sporting events engaged in rigging . furthermore , simpson noted this russian gangster attended trump s miss universe pageant in 2013 and sat in the Vip section alongside trump and other kremlin officials . interestingly enough , preet bharara was prosecuting a case against taiwanchik . bharara was fired by trump in 2017 . he noted that the patterns they noticed that suggested money laundering were quick deals made by individuals who attempted to veil their identity . those deals were a decade ago . however , simpson also noted there were still existing projects that reeked of fraud . specifically a project in panama , the one in toronto . those both got a lot of fraud associated with them , a lot of fraud allegations , a lot of activity that i would say smacks of fraud , and a lot of russian mafia figures listed as buyers who may or may not have actually put money into it . researchers were also concerned about trump s golf courses in scotland and ireland . you know , the golf courses trump is always bragging about . simpson noted that hundreds of millions of dollars came in from unknown sources , and eric trump once bragged about having unlimited amounts of money available for their golf course projects . hilariously , he went on to say his research suggested trump was really not a billionaire and couldn t do the things he s bragged about doing . so , you know , if you re familiar with donald trump s finances and the litigation over whether he s really a billionaire , you know , there s good reason to believe he doesn t have enough money to do this and that he would have had to have outside financial support for these things . the 165 - page document goes on to reveal more serious allegations . what it does provide though is further proof an in - depth investigation into trump s ties to russia must continue . if there was no collusion to swing the 2016 presidential election in trump s favor , there is still a massive amount of findings that suggest trump worked with russians in a money laundering scheme . featured image by thierry chesnot / getty images .

gallup released its annual list of the men and women who americans admire most . sitting atop both lists were two liberal icons , barack obama and hillary clinton , respectively . obama and clinton have had long runs at the number one spot , but among the celebrities and politicians who made it on the list were notable republicans . donald trump was the number two most admired man . the president was joined by republicans john mccain and mike pence on the list , along with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . however , it was the list of most popular women in the world that raised some eyebrows . hillary clinton and michelle obama were number one and number two on the list but three notable republican women made it into the top 10 . 7 . condoleezza rice 8 . melania trump 9 . nikki haley these three beat out beyonc and kate middleton . gallup goes on to note that while obama and hillary have had the top spots for years , their popularity has taken a big hit . clinton s and obama s standings this year are more tenuous than in the past . the 9 who name clinton is the lowest percentage she has received since 2002 , when 7 named her in another close first - place finish . clinton won the title this year in the same poll she registered a personal low favorable rating . this indicates she remains top of mind for enough people who like her to be named more than any other woman in response to the open - ended question , finishing ahead of some women who may be better liked overall but are not as prominent in people s minds . the percentage of adults naming obama as the most admired man is down from 22 last year , but he has been at or near 17 in several other years . here is the full list :

louis burke culture contact there s no denying the date of australia day is a controversial subject for all that call the island nation home . in a bold yet completely predictable move that has angered many , radio station triple j decided to move their iconic hottest 100 countdown from australia day to the fourth saturday of january . one man staunch in his beliefs the date should remain is refrigeration specialist jordan freeman ( 36 ) who says he will be boycotting the hottest 100 , a daring move considering he only listens to pantera . freeman insists that changing the date of the countdown is a sign of crude disrespect , which is why he will be listening to songs such as psycho holiday , slaughtered and suicide note pt ii instead . i won t be listening to triple j because that s denying our history when you change the date . pantera doesn t deny any history . have you seen the amount of confederate flags at their concerts according to freeman , it is people like him who will lead to the radio stations downfall , even though they haven t listened to the station since high school , they aren t afraid to share their opinion online using a skeleton giving an obscene hand gesture as their photo . although freeman admits he has not given the radio station a good listen since they stopped playing songs from a vulgar display of power , his boycott will still have some effect as he spends australia day in his garage jamming out with his mates who all have matching Rip dimebag tattoos . mate , i listened to the j back when it was double j . they play pussy music now and care about political correctness , but pantera keeps on rocking no matter how many band members get shot

california here we come january 24 , 2018 california residents celebrated new year ' s with the state legalizing " recreational marijuana . " state and local politicians were thinking of ways to spend the enhanced tax revenue they will receive . thousands of marijuana shop business license applications were submitted for approval . everything will now be wonderful . people will start being nice to each other again , the sun will shine , and everything will be groovy . what could go wrong before you could say , " contact high , " u . s . attorney general jeff sessions announced that he was revoking an obama era department of justice memo that instructed its u . s . attorneys to not enforce federal marijuana laws in those states that had legalized the drug for medicinal use . ah , bummer , dude . not only has california defied the federal government by declaring itself a " sanctuary state " for illegal aliens , now it ' s legalizing recreational marijuana i can hear ag sessions at a staff meeting declaring , " california , here we come . " for anyone considering investing in or opening a recreational marijuana business , i have a question : ever hear of federal civil and criminal forfeiture laws if ag sessions proceeds with unleashing dea in states that legalized the cultivation , possession , sale , and use of marijuana , it could be a rapid end to this budding enterprise ( pun intended ) . all real property , proceeds , equipment , vehicles , cash , and other assets gained from marijuana sales or used to facilitate marijuana dispensaries are subject to civil or criminal forfeiture . if the government can show that the owner of a building knew he was renting it to a marijuana business , the building would be subject to forfeiture . think that might deter a landlord from leasing his building to a pot business obviously , if a weed business owner buys his own building , it would be subject to forfeiture also . the rush to purchase otherwise useless land for the thousands of marijuana " farms " cropping up in california , oregon , washington , alaska , colorado and other states is also subject to forfeiture . i will go so far as to say that any tax money received by state and local governments is also subject to civil forfeiture , including anything purchased with the tax money . need a slightly used fire engine state and local governments need to sober up and face reality . it is still a federal crime to grow , possess , and distribute marijuana , a schedule i drug according to the controlled substance act . they need to realize that any additional money in taxes they receive could easily be spent on drug rehabilitation programs , increased fatal drugged driving collisions , industrial accidents , civil litigation and the like . know what a conspiracy is it ' s when two or more people agree to commit a crime , like selling marijuana . it doesn ' t matter what someone ' s role in the conspiracy was , the fact you ' re involved makes you liable for the future crimes of all the other members of the conspiracy the moment you join it . anyone who tends a marijuana farm , drives the weed to the dispensaries , fills the shelves with jars of marijuana , waits on customers , sweeps the floor , makes cash bank deposits or does anything else to facilitate the sale of marijuana is guilty of conspiracy in addition to the actual possession and sale of marijuana . a city official who issues a marijuana dispensary business license could also fall in that category . is this farfetched ag sessions has expressed lots of anti - marijuana sentiments . he ' s irritated at california for not cooperating with federal immigration officials . he has a law and order president who wants to end the opioid epidemic and probably believes that marijuana is a gateway drug to heroin use . so , is now the time to invest in the lucrative marijuana business in california and elsewhere i don ' t think so . enjoying your fsm article the family security foundation is a non - profit and we keep bringing you articles because of donors ' generous contributions . your tax - free contribution allows familysecuritymatters . org to continue to be your go to site for national security issues ready to support fsm click here .
lila rose , president of the pro - life group live action , says president trump is off to a promising start on pro - life issues , but she says the president and congress must do what it takes to defund planned parenthood at a time when democrats are voting in favor of infanticide . still in her 20 s , rose has been a leading pro - life activist for a decade , starting when she was 15 . she gained notoriety for videotaping her experiences posing as a pregnant teenager at various planned parenthood facilities . one year into the trump presidency and 45 years since the supreme court legalized abortion , rose gives the administration a decent grade on pro - life issues . i think the last year has been promising . i would use that word , especially the folks that he s surrounded himself with , and the appointments he s made , and the confirming of justice gorsuch . these are good signs , said rose . i think it s good that he showed up to speak from the rose garden at the march for life . i think his appointments are good on [ health and human services ] . the head of the department of justice is now investigating planned parenthood . these are good things , but we really have to achieve the biggest thing , which is stopping the government forcing of taxpayers to fund abortion chains , said rose . we are urging to administration to really lean on congress to make sure they get that bill to ensure that we re not funding the biggest abortion chain ( planned parenthood ) 1 . 5 million every day , added rose . republicans did try to include defunding of planned parenthood in various forms of obamacare repeal or reform legislation , only to be thwarted by the likes of republican sens . susan collins , r - maine , and lisa murkowski , r - alaska . rose worries congress members may be more eager to promise defunding planned parenthood than to actually do it . i am concerned about lip service and i think others in the movement are concerned . this is a really hard thing to do . you basically have to break 50 votes . depending on how the rules are changed or amended , you could get the vice president to weigh in and be the tiebreaker in the senate . there is a path to do it . it s a matter of is this going to be the most important thing for the administration when it comes to upholding the first human right and protecting human life in this country , said rose . the interview : while rose and other pro - life activists pressure lawmakers to make defunding planned parenthood a priority , she is appalled by how democrats approached friday s house vote on the born alive infant protection act . the legislation would require medical personnel to do whatever is possible to save the life of a baby if he or she emerges alive from the mother s womb following an attempted abortion . it reinforces existing policy but also adds criminal penalties , including up to five years in prison for failing to pursue life - saving measures . the bill passed , with all republicans voting for it , but 183 of 189 democrats opposed it . planned parenthood denounced the bill . medical guidelines and ethics already compel physicians facing life - threatening circumstances to respond . doctors and clinicians oppose this law because it prevents them from giving the best care to their patients . the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists strongly opposes this legislation , calling it a gross interference in the practice of medicine , ' said a planned parenthood statement . planned parenthood official dana singiser took it even further . the political agenda here is clear : to take away access to safe , legal abortion , said singiser in the same statement . but rose says the vote just shows how radical democrats are on abortion now . i think it just shows the insanity of the democratic party today , which is really going to hurt them in elections the more word gets out . this bill , the born alive infant protection act , wasn t even about abortion . it was about infanticide . it was about protecting children who have been born and who deserve to be protected , said rose . the fact that democrats in a huge voting bloc , tried to reject a bill that would protect against infanticide is extremely troubling . look , most of the electorate including in the democratic party want at least some restrictions on abortion . that s the majority of democrats , including democrat women , said rose . rose says democrats are increasingly marching to whatever tune planned parenthood is playing . they help elect these people so even though these folks try to mislead voters to say that they were more moderate or they cared about human rights or do what was best once in office , their elections are being funded by planned parenthood . they re going to march to the beat of their drum , even if that beat ultimately includes shooting down protections against infanticide , said rose . one of the major themes at friday s march for life was how science is on the side of the pro - life movement , especially with the advancements in ultrasound technology . rose says the assertions that life begins at birth or that viability should determine personhood are relics . if you create an arbitrary line at birth , then you are killing children who are viable before birth , children that are separated by inches of a birth canal from human rights protections . it s arbitrary . it doesn t make sense , said rose . and she says science changing beliefs about viability as well . viability is being increasingly moved backwards . children can now survive outside the womb with medical assistance a little past 21 weeks . that s incredible . the more we develop our medical technology , the more and more that viability line will change . people are realizing it s an arbitrary line and that life , as science reveals , begins at the moment of conception , said rose . rose says the pro - life movement has a lot of momentum both politically and to some extent in the courts . however , she contends congress needs to seize the momentum and end taxpayer subsidies for planned parenthood to be a true success . she also claims cultural momentum , pointing out that more americans are pro - life , and young people a major reason why . rose also says the personal stories of mothers who carry difficult pregnancies to term and the testimonies of former abortion clinic workers are changing minds around the nation .

two black leaders who were prevented from demonstrating outside the smithsonian african - american history museum against a decades - long genocide carried out against black children through abortion resolved a free - speech case against the federal government in their favor . rev . clenard h . childress jr . , pastor of a black church in the newark , new jersey , area , and jacqueline hawkins , director minority outreach for the non - profit center for bio - ethical reform , filed suit after an official with the national museum of african american history and culture in washington , d . c . , and uniformed police officers from the office of protection services told them they could not stand outside the museum with their sign . the protest in february was part of a project by the center for bio - ethical reform , or cbr , that uses photo - mural exhibits and literature to demonstrate the devastation of abortion s consequences on the african american community . like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wnd . com , america s independent news network . the parties filed a settlement aug . 30 in which the federal government formally acknowledged that the public sidewalks forming the perimeter of the national museum of african american history and culture are available for first amendment activity . the government also agreed to pay attorney s fees to the nonprofit american freedom law center , which represented the protesters . robert muise , aflc co - founder and senior counsel , said there was no question that our clients had a clear right under the first amendment to engage in their peaceful , non - obstructive free speech activity on the public sidewalks outside of this museum . the government was wrong for denying our clients that right , and they knew it , he said . the other plaintiffs in the lawsuit were cbr and its executive director , gregg cunningham , who was standing by during the incident . childress and hawkins , who direct the cbr project targeting the history museum , testified that when they were told they could not stand outside the museum with their sign , childress responded that they were on a public sidewalk . the senior ops officer warned the two that if they did not move to a remote location across the street , he and his fellow officers would physically move them . the officer also warned that they would be subject to arrest . rather than face arrest or physical force , childress and hawkins followed the officer s order . in june , aflc filed a federal lawsuit in federal court in washington against the museum , ops and several federal officials . shortly after the lawsuit was filed , the justice department contacted aflc attorneys , who confirmed the protesters first amendment rights and stated the federal government wanted to settle the case . david yerushalmi , aflc co - founder and senior counsel , asserted that in addition to being a gross violation of our clients fundamental rights , the actions of the museum officials and their armed security demonstrate the hypocrisy of the left . progressives claim to be for diversity and tolerance , but if you don t march in lockstep with their narrative , they use force and the threat of force to shut you down , he said . here , we were able to use the federal courts to turn that narrative on its head . the suit alleged violations of the first and fifth amendments as well as the federal religious freedom restoration act . disproportionate harm among the signs held by the protesters was one pointing out that while black women are 11 percent of the population , they are victims in 36 percent of abortions . they contend planned parenthood and abortion care have suppressed the black vote more effectively that poll taxes , literacy tests , voter id requirements , and ku klux klan lynchings combined . the signs point out that by 2014 , 18 million african - american babies had been killed , calling it a black genocide . the lawsuit asserted the museum hides from its visitors the fact that abortion is disproportionately harming the african american community and celebrates supporters of abortion . they noted that the museum promotes the black lives matter movement , which the protesters describe as viciously pro - abortion . and they pointed to the museum s celebration of justice thurgood marshall , the first african - american to serve on the u . s . supreme court , who was pro - abortion , while completely ignoring current justice clarence thomas , who is pro - life . like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wnd . com , america s independent news network .

it is rather hard to write with eclipse glasses on this morning , but i want to be ready , as the old spiritual intones . not ever known for culinary process , i even tried to turn oreos into eclipse cookies . massive fail like many others , i have anticipated this day with a sense of foreboding and wonder . the foreboding is a lot less than the wonder , to be sure . the foreboding in my case has to do with religious quacks that claim a natural scientific event is an act of god s judgment or an apocalyptic event signaling the end of time . that this portent , which happens quite regularly , by the way , has to haul this fake theological freight creates a stumbling block to coherent belief . it is a responsible perspective to hold a worldview that attends to the wisdom of both theology and science . another of these celestial alignments will happen in 2024 , and i suspect many of the same arguments will be in vogue . it will be an election year , so beware some will proclaim that god is judging a godless nation by blotting out the sun , and who knows but this might be the very last chance we have to repent . please understand , i am all for repentance deep , daily and determined . god s call always beckons us to turn around to traverse a more life - giving pathway , but i demur at the heated rhetoric of an interventionist theology that only sees god active in the cataclysmic . god is at work in the regularity of seasons , circadian rhythms and evolutionary trajectories . the old language of calling a brutal storm or other inexplicable event an act of god is receding , thankfully . i do recall when yorkminster cathedral was hit by lightning in 1980 and insurance adjustors and religious figures debated whether to call it a divine action . some concluded that it was because of a liberal bishop ; others were less convinced . it is hard to believe that this language persists . better to see the whole of creation within providential care , even if it is not a tightly controlled oversight . terrible and beautiful things occur , often all mixed up together . god is not absent from any of them , and the presence of suffering provokes interrogation of a benevolent deity . human participation in the unfinished , groaning creation sometimes wreaks more havoc ; it is hard to calculate the extent of our influence for good or evil . wonder far outstrips foreboding , however . i am thrilled by the fervor with which people have planned ahead to secure the best viewing spots . i delight in the ways this astronomical occasion provides teachers with an expansive scientific lesson . i relish the new learning about animal and crop behavior during a solar eclipse , especially as this is a key concern for those of us who live in the plains . i chortle at the kids who tried out their glasses days in advance , just in case . i revel , also , in the capacity of humans to experience wonder . we were made for this , you know . it was rudolf otto , a scholar of religion in the early 20 th century , who wrote about the idea of the holy , contending that each one of us has an inherent response to the numinous realities of life . by numinous he meant a divine power at work that invites us to a sense of mystery , fear and , perhaps , worship . at the heart of the religious impulse is the sense of grandeur of god s creation , the idea that something lies behind the phenomena of earthly processes . a pious christian , otto sought to defend belief from naturalistic tendencies , the argument that the whole of this world can be explained without a theistic hypothesis . it is very instructive for human beings to experience themselves as both infinitesimal and significant , with an appropriate understanding of their place in the scale of our universe . this means we understand that we are latecomers , beneficiaries of a long history that preceded us . we are dependent on all the life forms that have gone before , as well as those that continue to companion humanity today . it also means that the glorious beauty that surrounds us points to a vast intelligence beyond our comprehension . our recognition of both our frailty and magnificent vocation as god s image bearers kindles wonder that god is mindful of us , as psalm 8 states . i hope our experience of this event illumines a spirit of contemplation as we marvel at god s handiwork and the perdurance of an expanding universe . i also hope that we find ever more constructive ways to hold both science and faith in our heart . we must read both books of scripture and of nature . holding them together makes for an informed sense of wonder . related opinion : genius hesitates , both in science and religion scott dickison
as our nation celebrated labor day , giving attention to the role and dignity of workers , we should also consider the role of human agency in accomplishing divine labor . theologians always interrogate such things surely the work of christians is more than simply fueling the engine of capitalism ; meaningful work also participates in god s intention for the world . yet , determining how god is at work in this world is one of the hardest theological challenges . think about the urgent crises confronting us . people of faith pray for deliverance , trusting god to hold back the waters of the sea or help them elude their enemies pushing them over the border in myanmar or rid them of the malignancy growing in their bodies or quell the rising tide of white supremacy . fervent prayer may not create the conditions for which they pray ; however , many continue to trust that god s providence will prevail . we must ask : through what instrumentality reading narratives of deliverance in scripture evokes hope for god s mighty acts to be victorious once again . many preachers and sunday school teachers have followed the lectionary texts from exodus in this extended season after pentecost . we have noted the trickery of shiphrah and puah , the resistance of pharaoh s daughter and miriam , and god s call of moses . we have pondered the extended saga of israel in egypt , questioning why deliverance was long delayed . in these early chapters , the writer declares that god has heard their groaning , and remembered god s covenant , seen the misery of the people , and has come down to rescue them from the power of egypt . the suffering of the people touches the heart of god , although god leans the plans for deliverance upon humans who are themselves part of the oppressed . the means by which god has come down to rescue does not seem very sturdy , and how god will be involved is at question . god s commission to moses is for him to go to pharaoh and bring my people out of egypt . god s promise is very simple : i will be with you , and the proof that it is truly god who sends him is this : when you have brought the people out of egypt , you shall all worship god here on this mountain ( exodus 3 : 12 ) . what it is only after the liberation is accomplished that moses will know who propelled him into this high stakes mission oh my i often hear persons wonder out loud why god does not work in our day as god worked in biblical times . it appears that god does indeed work in the same way , inviting people to shared responsibility for god s handiwork , which we inhabit and stain and heal . i believe that god is always calling humanity to do the needed holy work and that god is the power behind the actions of those courageous enough to trust god . in a world where things can go terribly wrong such as the human evocation of climate change that wreaks havoc god is using every means to mend creation . the incarnation of jesus teaches that god s primary means of conducting redemptive work is through a partnership with humans who were tasked at the beginning to tend god s handiwork . a long , grinding and luminous history of evolution antedates the human arrival , albeit a particular stewardship is required of those whom god has granted dominion . kathryn tanner reminds us that god works in history at a different level than humans . for tanner , divine and human agency are not in competition with one another . because god is not in the same order of being as creatures , god s power is universally extended and is at work in all things . thus , there is no zero - sum game that suggests the more god is at work , the less humans can do and vice versa . tanner , rather , points us to a renewed vision of how the incarnation determines how divine and human agency can be at work in the same person , who is a paradigm for how god chooses to accomplish the divine purpose . she calls us to think about god as gift giver , who not only imbues the christ with holy presence to transform the horizon of human hopes , but makes possible human participation in christ toward the same goal of redemption . her theological vision that christ is the key to what god is doing everywhere in the world guides our thinking about how human work and godly work always interface . through god s humility , we are always ingredient to saving work . in times of challenge , trusting that god is at work empowering humans to work for the good of all is reassuring . it also prompts courageous action . while it is common to think that we are waiting on god , actually both god and others are waiting on us .
a global catastrophe is but two minutes away , according to the doomsday clock , which measures , metaphorically , how long the world has left before it succumbs to a man - made disaster . managed by the bulletin of atomic scientists , a group of scientists and academics , the clock was moved 30 seconds on thursday . the clock s hands had been at two - and - a - half minutes to midnight in 2017 . rachel bronson , bulletin of the atomic scientists ceo , said this year that nuclear weapons and the unpredictability of nations holding them were a major consideration . all of the major weapons states are investing in their nuclear arsenals , said robert rosner , research professor in the department of astrophysics and physics at the university of chicago . north korea s nuclear and missile tests demonstrated an accelerating of building a new generation of weapons of mass destruction . in south asia , the emphasis on missile capabilities grows . the nuclear arsenals of all of the major weapons states are being updated and imbued with enhanced capabilities . the trump administration s nuclear posture review appears likely to increase the types and roles of nuclear weapons in us defense plans , he added . sharon squassoni , from george washington university , said us - russian relations were key element to the board s decision . both countries still possess about 95 percent of the world s nuclear weapons and without bilateral progress there is little incentive for others to move forward . however , for the first time in many years no us - russian nuclear arms control negotiations are underway , squassoni said . if the draft us nuclear posture review is any guide to us policy , there will be no us - russia nuclear arms control negotiations for the foreseeable future . instead we could see a return to a nuclear arms race . set for official release in february , a leaked draft of the us review on nuclear strategies indicated that it will push to develop more low - yield nukes due to concerns over china , iran , and russia s capabilities . for decades the clock has been used as an ominous reminder of how close humanity is to destroying the world . midnight represents total disaster or an apocalypse . originally decided on by bulletin editor eugene rabinowitch , the clock is now in its 71 st year . it s settings are now based on an academic board s view on the advancement of nuclear arms , climate change and artificial intelligence . the doomsday clock originally featured in a magazine back in the 1940 s , when the development of nuclear arms first became a global fear . in its first outing the clock read seven minutes to midnight . the furthest away from midnight it has ever been came in 1991 after the end of the cold war when it struck 17 minutes to midnight . earlier this year , the bulletin s nuclear notebook warned of north korea s nuclear missile potential . based on available information , we cautiously estimate that north korea might have produced sufficient fissile material to build 30 to 60 nuclear weapons , and that it might possibly have assembled 10 to 20 warheads , the report , co - written by federation of american scientists researcher hans m kristensen , stated .

the back and forth fight between the trump administration and the courts on the constitutionality and legality of the trump - travel ban may be nearing an end . originally , the supreme court had allowed the trump administration to reinstate part of the travel ban at the end of 2017 ; however , the federal appeals court in san francisco found that trump had overstepped his authority . according to reuters : the appeals court ruled that mr . trump had exceeded the authority congress had given him over immigration and had violated a part of the immigration laws barring discrimination in the issuance of visas . in their appeal to the supreme court , solicitor general noel francisco remarked : the courts below have overridden the president s judgments on sensitive matters of national security and foreign relations , and severely restricted the ability of this and future presidents to protect the nation . those against the travel ban have continually argued that trump s ban is unconstitutional as it is directed unfairly toward countries that have a majority of muslim citizens . they point to trump s own comments during his presidential campaign regarding muslims . the president has repeatedly explained that the two orders pursue the same aim . however , the trump team have denied the allegations of discrimination . the proclamation s process and substance confirm that its purpose was to achieve national security and foreign - policy goals , not to impose anti - muslim bias . arguments are planned for april , and the court estimates a ruling will come by june . additionally , the supreme court has a docket loaded with major issues including voting rights , union power , digital privacy and a clash between claims of religious freedom and gay rights . featured image by mark wilson / getty images .
while most of us only want to do what is best for our children some of us have a warped view of what exactly that is . sure , we all think our children are content but are they gaslighting , for those who do not know , is a form of psychological abuse . it is a tactic many abusers use to make someone feel as if their reality is completely incorrect . this is a very manipulative tactic and it takes a big toll on the victim . while some of this happens in romantic relationships it is also often present in parent - child relationships as well . gaslighting is something that is done slowly and leaves the victim practically brainwashed . people who are gaslighting their children may not realize they are doing so because for some it could even be part of a cycle but it is something that needs to stop . if the following list of signs stand out to you in your relationship with your child you need to do better and really change your ways . 5 signs you are gaslighting your children : 1 . you mock your children . humiliating your children whether you realize you are doing so or not can be considered gaslighting . mocking your children leaves them feeling confused and upset . this is not an acceptable thing to do . just because you don t think they should be upset over something doesn t mean you should make them feel like what they are feeling is invalid . sure , as the parent you are the one in control , but you should not be overassertive . while we all are afraid of our children branching out and taking flight on their own we need to accept that it will happen . don t make your child feel like by being more independent he or she is doing anything wrong . you should not make your child feel helpless without you , one day you will not be around . you children need to know how to function without you . 3 . you never apologize . as parents , even we can be wrong from time to time . it is important to say sorry when we make mistakes . we should not be making out children feel like they are always doing things wrong even when they aren t . while it may be hard to apologize to your children it is important to do so in some cases . 4 . you are too hard on your child . sure , sometimes kids make mistakes , this is perfectly normal . flying off the handle each and every time is not going to help the situation . don t make your child hide things from you if you are constantly overreacting they will stop sharing things with you . sure , discipline is important but only to an extent . it is not the end of the world every time your son or daughter forgets to do a chore or something of the sort . you tell your child he or she is overreacting when in all reality he or she is not . this is not a good way to parent . you should not tell your children what they should or shouldn t be feeling . their emotions are their own , you cannot change them . this goes hand in hand with the parents who try to tell their children what they do and do not like , it does not work like that . featured image via curious mind magazine
have you ever stopped to really consider the wide assortment of fears and phobias that exist in today s society from zombies to public speaking , clowns to heights there appears to be a fear for nearly anything that you can think of . don t believe me there s even a technical term for the fear of phobias . that s right , phobophobia is defined as the fear of phobia ( s ) and , more specifically , of the internal sensations associated with that phobia and anxiety . these fears can range from a mere inconvenience to completely debilitating , impacting every area of your life and interfering with your ability to function normally . recently chapman university initiated a nationwide survey , asking americans just what strikes fear deep in their hearts . participants were asked their level of fear relating to approximately 80 different possible fears ranging from the government to natural disasters . the researchers then compiled the data and came up with a list of the top fears in the united states which included some interesting and eye - opening answers , such as corrupt government officials , pollution of drinking water , high medical bills and air pollution . while the answers of the chapman university survey on american fears were bigger concerns , focusing largely on politics and worldwide pollution , many americans share fears that hit much closer to home . it is estimated that 25 million americans share a fear of flying , or aerophobia , while trypanophobia , or a fear of needles can have a significant impact on your ability to obtain necessary , life - saving health care . acknowledging the potential impact that these fears can have on our life and well - being , experts have devoted time , energy and funding into better understanding the cause and treatment of various fears , phobias and anxiety . one area that has researchers and experts incredibly hopeful is the use of hypnosis in treatment . in order to understand how hypnosis can work , you must first have a thorough understanding of the way that phobias occur mentally . at some point in our lives , often throughout childhood ( although they can develop as an adult ) , something causes our mind to create an association between two unrelated things the object of our fear , and the feelings associated with the fear reaction . in some cases , this association is created due to a traumatic event , for example , a dog bite as a child can lead to a lifelong fear of dogs . in other examples , however , the trigger may not be as easily identified . in fact , you may not even know why you are afraid of something , you just know that you are . hypnosis works by reprogramming the way that your mind reacts to that specific trigger . if dogs are currently associated with feelings of fear and anxiety , a hypnotherapist will work to relax the mind , desensitize the brain to that event or object , and reprogram the response . it s important to note that the this isn t a quick fix the procedure , known as systematic desensitization , is a gradual reprogramming , slowing giving you control over your response to the trigger and encouraging positive responses . with hard work , dedication and the assistance of a good hypnotherapist , you can find freedom from your biggest fears

the truth about the israel - palestine conflict headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next israel . palestine . jews . arabs . have you ever asked yourself why the situation in the middle - east doesn t seem to be getting any better these days and what s this conflict all about in the first place in case you re totally new to world politics , the middle - east crisis is one of the most politically and religiously charged conflicts on the whole planet virtually every country in the world has had a say on how these two cultures and peoples , very different from each other should share the land that they both want to claim as their home and native land . we have the israelis who wish to have a homeland for the jews with jerusalem as its capital . we have the palestinians who wish to have a homeland for their people and wish to claim some parts of jerusalem ( east ) as its capital . both sides have committed atrocities and inhumane actions towards each other . both sides continually agree to disagree with each other when trying to negotiate peace talks . both sides claim ownership of the disputed territories for thousands of years . some call israel an apartheid state . some say the palestinians are being used as a means to drive the jews into the mediterranean sea . we can go back and forth arguing about this non - stop until someone drops a bomb on all of israel and wipes everybody out but we don t have to go to extremes like that in order to understand the truth of the matter , and to once and for all put an end to the dispute on both sides , and move forward for the sake of humanity and the evolving human spirit . note : i personally know what it s like to be involved in a bitter legal dispute where both sides wanted to prove their point was right . yes , children were involved so the stakes were high and emotions were high , and it got very ugly towards the end . but now , that s all water under the bridge with time a solution was found it came from a totally unexpected source , but nevertheless , it ended a bitter dispute that would never have ended , as both sides were at a legal stalemate . so from that experience , i bring to you a different view and perspective of the israel / palestine conflict , and how it be resolved very simply and fairly for both sides . what is presented here is nothing but the truth . the reason why past solutions and resolutions failed was the truth was never presented so that all sides could see with clarity , enabling them to make an informed decision based on logic and facts , rather than heresay , pride and charged emotions that have caused too many people to suffer or die needlessly . why don t we start from the beginning then . since christians , jews and muslims share the same genetic and cultural history , from the days of abraham , we will use the authroized king james version of the bible and / or the jewish tanakh as our sole reference . for anyone that questions the integrity of the kjv bible or the tanakh , we invite you to see two of many mathematical and historical proofs to show that the words penned in those scripts are an integrated message that was written in a domain outside of our boundaries of space and time . jerusalem is a very old city . we do not know how far back in time it dates , but we see it first being mentioned here : joshua 10 : 1 now it came to pass , when adonizedek king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai , and had utterly destroyed it ; as he had done to jericho and her king , so he had done to ai and her king ; and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel , and were among them ; at first glance , this verse may not sound like a big deal , but when we look a little closer we can clearly see that ; jerusalem was originally inhabited by peoples and had a king named adonizedek joshua was on a mission to conquer territories that were neighbouring to jerusalem the children of israel struck fear into the leaders and kings of cities that had yet to encounter joshua and his tribe if we dig a little deeper , we see that just a few verses away , we see why the then king of jerusalem was afraid : joshua 10 : 3 wherefore adonizedek king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron , and unto piram king of jarmuth , and unto japhia king of lachish , and unto debir king of eglon , saying , joshua 10 : 4 come up unto me , and help me , that we may smite gibeon : for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel . joshua 10 : 5 therefore the five kings of the amorites , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , the king of eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before gibeon , and made war against it . king adonizedek was so terrified of the approaching children of israel that he ran to neighbouring cities to ask them for help in defending themselves against the impending attack . we see that the 5 cities listed were predominantly of amorite nationality . a quick search on amorite in the bible brings up some interesting verses , but one in particular , stands out for the purpose of this lesson : amos 2 : 9 yet destroyed i the amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet i destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath . for good measure , we ll also focus on the king of hebron and his origins , since he was mentioned as being in allegiance with the king of jerusalem to overthrow the children of israel . joshua 15 : 13 and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah , according to the commandment of the lord to joshua , even the city of arba the father of anak , which city is hebron . what we see from these two verses is that : the amorites were giants . hebron is an amorite city where arba the father of anak once dwelled . before we go further about who arba and anak were , let s take a look at another important city that has been mentioned quite often in the news lately . gaza is a very old city . we do not know how far back in time it dates , but we see it first being mentioned here : genesis 10 : 19 and the border of the canaanites was from sidon , as thou comest to gerar , unto gaza ; as thou goest , unto sodom , and gomorrah , and admah , and zeboim , even unto lasha . joshua 11 : 22 there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel : only in gaza , in gath , and in ashdod , there remained . what we learn from these two verses is that : gaza was inhabited by peoples called canaanites before the children of israel showed up on the scene . gaza was inhabited by people called anakims . going back to joshua 15 : 13 , we can see that the anakim peoples were descended from someone called anak , and inhabited the areas along the coast and around jerusalem before the children of israel , later to be the jews invaded those territories . now with these facts , it might seem as though the palestinian people today inhabited the land of israel before the jews did , and therefore have a right to call those lands their home . but , let us dig a bit deeper shall we . who exactly are the anakim people well , let s see what the bible has to say numbers 13 : 33 and there we saw the giants , the sons of anak , which come of the giants : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight . okay . now we re onto something . giants had inhabited the lands where the children of israel , led by god invaded the canaanite territories and eventually settled in and around jerusalem . generations later , a kingdom and temple would be established and destroyed , but only for a brief moment in time . going back to the giants , these weren t just your average tall person that we commonly see in society today , usually as athletes like basketball players that are anywhere between 7 and 10 feet . these giants were much bigger , and meaner and can first be traced back to here : genesis 6 : 4 there were giants in the earth in those days ; and also after that , when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men , and they bare children to them , the same became mighty men which were of old , men of renown . genesis 6 : 12 and god looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth . genesis 6 : 13 and god said unto noah , the end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , i will destroy them with the earth . genesis 6 : 17 and , behold , i , even i , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die . genesis 6 : 18 but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons wives with thee . what we learn from this is that sometime in the past the was an alien invasion , whereby the sons of god ( fallen angels that followed lucifer s rebellion in the pre - adamite days ) introduced themselves to humanity , interbred with them whereby their offspring were mutants , half - human / half - annunaki . not only was interbreeding done between humans and the nephilim , but because they had advanced technology , they introduced genetic manipulation into the the flora and fauna on the earth ; mixing dna with just about every living carbon - based organism . this was done to corrupt humanity , and for lucifer and his legion of followers to wipe humanity off the face of the earth and to reclaim it as their own again yes , that s right aliens are real . they are specifically mentioned in the bible , as being in league with the adversary , satan , the devil , lucifer , for he is an alien too so now we get a clearer picture of why joshua and the children of israel were given divine powers and authority to rid the levant of the giant population these giants trace their roots back to noah s flood , but somehow some of them survived and managed to slowly repopulate the earth . their next attempt to thwart god s plan for humanity was to construct a tower in babel , iraq where nimrod became a ruthless ( might hunter ) warrior and dictator . all world religions and their customs can be traced back to nimrod . sikhism , taosim , buddhism and all other eastern religions , islamic traditions , catholic traditions , greek traditions and so many more got their origins not long after the flood when the surviving nephilim / annunaki reinfested the generations that followed after noah with everything we know today about witchcraft , sorcery , prostitution , worshiping inanimate objects , rituals , astrology , necromancy , capitalism , socialism , child / blood sacrifices and a host of other idolatrous practices that serve humanity no purpose except to deter it from evolving into what it was created to be after reading this it should be very clear what god s intentions were when he told the children of israel to slay every man , woman , child and animal that they encountered in those cities . joshua 6 : 20 so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets : and it came to pass , when the people heard the sound of the trumpet , and the people shouted with a great shout , that the wall fell down flat , so that the people went up into the city , every man straight before him , and they took the city . joshua 6 : 21 and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword . it was a city that contained an unstable population of human / nephilim half - breed that are the cause of all corruption on earth , and had to be eliminated at all costs . call it the first alien virus that could wipe out humanity . slowly and surely human babies might be cute , but hybrid human / demonic beings are something else altogether . there are many things that mainstream churches , mosques , synagogues , temples and schools will not teach you , and for good reason our entire society has been influenced by the annunaki / nephilim and this is the reason for all the oppression , wars , inequality , strife and all other human woes that we can never seem to totally get rid of . in order to truly make the change that humanity needs to go in , we need to stop hiding from the truth , come to terms with it and make the necessary changes in ourselves and our attitudes first , before pointing fingers at anyone . anyone pointing and wagging fingers without first examining all the evidence and coming to terms with it is just a hypocrite and should be avoided or shown the ways of their error . we need to consider the alien option when dealing with what s going on in the middle east , for this will impact the rest of the world , whether it is ready or not . the americans have disclosed their proofs of encounters with aliens , their technology and culture , so it should be the same for israel and palestine to call things out as they really are , and to stop using the world stage to do a song and dance that did not originate with them in the lands they wish to claim as their own , but originated a long time ago by a prideful angelic being named lucifer that thought he knew god s plan better than god himself don t let that be your mistake for you will join lucifer and all those who supported him directly and indirectly as they rejected the message of the bible and its plan for humanity . be glad and thankful that yoU were created for a royal purpose you are replacement staff for the fallen angels that vacated their homes on the planet heaven revelation 2 : 25 but that which ye have already hold fast till i come . revelation 2 : 26 and he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will i give power over the nations : revelation 2 : 27 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as i received of my father . revelation 2 : 28 and i will give him the morning star . that s right the elohim ( god the father , jesus christ and the holy spirit ) have an evolutionary plan for humanity . we are to be transformed bodily in be capable of assuming our new roles as royal heirs to the coming kingdom which will be headquartered in jerusalem in the not too distant future . i hope this provides a more insightful look into the israel / palestine conflict and why it will take a supernatural event in order to clear the air and change the rules of how the game will be played . how will things change well , jesus said it himself what to watch for matthew 24 : 32 now learn a parable of the fig tree ; when his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh : matthew 24 : 33 so likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors . matthew 24 : 34 verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled . matthew 24 : 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my father only . matthew 24 : 37 but as the days of noe were , so shall also the coming of the son of man be . matthew 24 : 38 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that noe entered into the ark , matthew 24 : 39 and knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be . more truths about giants , aliens , world politics and the future of humanity to come

fake news : a weird wednesday collection headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next fake news this term has become quite the buzz word over the past year or so , almost to the point where you can t read the comment section of any news article without seeing it shouted at least once or twice . but , fake news isn t new . i once read , many years ago , that newspapers would often publish completely fictitious news , under the guise of reaL news , to help drum up readership . i m sure that most readers at the time had a pretty good understanding of what was real and what wasn t , just as contemporary readers can usually discern between actual news and the sensational stuff found in grocery store tabloids . they knew the difference between entertainment and what was actually going on in their community . however , as modern readers go back and look at these vintage archives , it can be a tad confusing . was this actual news did the people of the time beLieve it to be real just what the heck was going on i love looking through old newspaper archives , and many times , i find some really strange little gems and while newspaper articles featuring fantastical stories can be found year round , even in our local publications , i recently noticed that quite a few were published in the month of january . january of 1914 was an especially weird month for some reason . 1 . the mountain octopus : the story of the mountain octopus appeared in local papers on january 11 , 1946 . a group of students in thomas , wv , discovered several of the creatures in a local stream , and brought two back to school with them to show to staff / students . no one was ever quite sure how and why an ocean creature got ( and survived ) in our cold , freshwater streams of west virginia . 2 . hungarian woman sought murder clue from spirits : this strange story appeared in a huntington , wv newspaper on january 23 , 1914 . a widow from thurmond , wv made a stop in huntington after traveling to ohio to seek the services of a well - known medium . the woman was seeking information from the spirits concerning her husband s recent murder . 3 . meteor , or bad omen over huntington : here s another weird story from huntington , wv that appeared in the local paper on january 13 , 1914 . around that time , a meteor was seen streaking over the skies of huntington . however , a group of kids playing near the old c o hospital claimed that they saw the meteor then spell out a name in fire , and then morph into the image of a woman s face in the sky 4 . women in hysterics as ghost runs down street : although the account was published in a local paper on january 8 , 1914 , this tale actually comes from new york and is a humorous telling of how a prisoner on the loose with a sheet flung over his head terrorized some church ladies leaving a service . i won t come out and say that any of these news stories are actually fake news , but i will venture to assume that january has , historically , been a slow month for reporters here in the tri - state source : < URL >

the trump administration has suffered many losses within its ranks . it s seen several of those brought in leave . however , they ve also seen seasoned , experienced , long - time experts leave after becoming frustrated with the way trump treats everything . another long - time expert within the state department is leaving . foreign policy reported : in the latest departure , the state department s most experienced u . n . - based sanctions expert stepped down friday , sending more than a decade of expertise out the door and contributing to a bout of brain drain that is diminishing the role of american diplomats in shaping washington s sanctions policy that tome of knowledge and expertise would be joshua black . black was the chief sanctions and counterterrorism expert at the united nations , and america is losing him thanks to his frustration with the trump administration . according to sources , part of black s frustration had to do with the iran nuclear deal that trump has opposed vehemently . furthermore , the trump administration has overstepped the state dept . several times . black s resignation coincides with a shift in the way washington approaches sanctions , current and former officials say . the white house has been bypassing the state department s seasoned veterans while tasking the u . s . military and intelligence establishment to step up their role in uncovering violations , particularly in iran and north korea , those officials say . one official told foreign policy that black and his team were essential to the department for coordinating sanctions in the [ united nations . ] and we re losing him thanks to trump . trump wants to make america a safer nation except he continues to cause the experts to leave . featured image by jeff swensen / getty images .
amid deep partisan divide , pence breaks tie to confirm religious freedom nominee january 25 , 2018 in the u . s . senate wednesday , vice president mike pence stepped in to break a partisan 49 - 49 tie on president trump ' s nomination of kansas gov . sam brownback for the post of ambassador - at - large for international religious freedom . every democrat , joined by independent sens . angus king of maine and bernie sanders of vermont , voted against brownback ' s nomination , while the republicans lost their narrow advantage due to the absence of two senators . the gop controls 51 of the senate ' s 100 seats , but sen . john mccain of arizona is undergoing cancer treatment and senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker ( r - tenn . ) is in davos for the world economic forum . so in his role as president of the senate , pence cast the tie - breaking vote first during a procedural vote to end debate on brownback ' s nomination , and then again in the final roll call vote , which passed 50 - 49 . it was the second time pence has broken a tied nomination vote . on february 7 last year he did so to advance betsy devos as education secretary by a 51 - 50 vote . on that occasion republican sens . lisa murkowski ( alaska ) and susan collins ( me . ) voted with the democrats against trump ' s nominee . after the vote , brownback tweeted his thanks to trump , pence , " and all the senators who supported my nomination . i ' m looking forward to starting my new position as ambassador and working hard for the american people and religious freedom around the world . " in a tweet of his own , pence said he was proud to cast the tie - breaking vote , describing brownback as " a principled man of faith who will help the trump admin advance support for persecuted religious groups around the world . " trump first nominated brownback as ambassador - at - large last july . the last person to hold the post , rabbi david saperstein , stepped down when president obama left office last january . wednesday ' s vote was a close shave for brownback , who himself served in the senate for 14 years until seven years ago . the kansas governor has upset many democrats with social conservative policies on abortion and lgbt issues , including a 2015 executive order that rescinded protections for lgbt state workers . leading the charge against him on the senate floor wednesday , sen . bob menendez ( d - n . j . ) said the person who holds the ambassadorship must be committed to defending the religious freedom of all religious minorities around the world . " unfortunately , gov . brownback ' s career has been defined by a lack of tolerance for those who do not share his own beliefs , " he said . " i fear he will only focus solely on protecting christian minorities , while we must acknowledge publicly that people of all faiths are persecuted and demand equal representation . " menendez went on to cite other brownback policy positions , including on lgbt issues , and said that during brownback ' s term in the senate he had " often used religion to push policies that undermine the right of women to access healthcare , to control their own bodies and determine their own destinies . " daniel darling , vice president for communications at the ethics religious liberty commission ( erlc ) of the southern baptist convention said on his twitter feed it was " sad the nomination of governor brownback is being politicized for this important position . " darling noted that the erlc had " worked well " with the last person to hold the post , despite not seeing eye - to - eye on many issues at home . " we disagreed with rabbi saperstein on many domestic issues but worked well with him on international religious freedom , " he said . " this is a bipartisan issue . " saperstein , who was the director of the religious action center for reform judaism , was president obama ' s second nominee to the international religious freedom post , serving from jan . 2015 - jan . 2017 . before that , baptist pastor suzan johnson cook held the position from apr . 2011 - oct . 2013 . the top religious freedom post was vacant for almost half of obama ' s eight years in office ( 43 months out of 96 ) , and religious freedom campaigners were troubled by how long it took him - 513 days after his inauguration - to first announce a nomination . trump nominated brownback 186 days after taking office . cair complaint in his remarks opposing the confirmation wednesday , menendez did not elaborate on his stated concern that brownback would " focus solely on protecting christian minorities . " but the council on american - islamic relations has complained about brownback actions such as his signing into law of a bill in 2012 designed to block any use of islamic law ( shari ' a ) in state courts or government agencies . " only under the trump administration would someone so opposed to the constitutional rights of an american faith community be appointed to safeguarding international religious freedom , " cair government affairs director robert mccaw said when brownback was nominated . as a senator , brownback in 2005 called on then - u . n . secretary - general kofi annan to resign unless the world body acted decisively to stop the carnage in sudan ' s darfur region , where the victims ( as well as the perpetrators ) were muslims . his senate career also saw brownback advocate strongly for religious freedom and rights protection in non - islamic countries , including china , vietnam and north korea . victims of persecution in those countries include christians , but also independent buddhists , tibetan buddhists , uighur muslims and falun gong adherents . brownback was a key sponsor of the 1998 international religious freedom act which established both the ambassador - at - large post and the u . s . commission on international religious freedom , an independent statutory body . uscirf chairman daniel mark on wednesday welcomed the confirmation , saying the commission was looking forward to working with brownback " in advancing the u . s . government ' s promotion of international religious freedom .

on friday , both parties in congress were unable to meet in the middle , and the u . s . government began the process of shutting down . even after a meeting between senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - ny ) and donald trump at the white house , they were unable to come to any promising ground . and now , the finger - pointing has begun , and trump is pointing a big , sausagy orange stub at democrats . trump took to twitter saturday morning to lay all the blame on congressional democrats . he tweeted : democrats are holding our military over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration . can t let that happen hold up a minute . during the momentous roundtable that was caught on camera , trump displayed a shocking moment where many thought he d actually work with democrats to reach a deal . granted , republicans almost had a conniption fit when trump said he d sign anything put in front of him . after saying that , he was presented with a bipartisan deal , and he refused to sign it . additionally , trump can point that little orange nub at democrats all he wants , but at one point he did say he thought a government shutdown would be good for the country . back in 2013 , he tweeted : [ email protected ] leadership should not be afraid of a government shutdown . they should be afraid of not defunding obamacare . he also tweeted : 83 of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41 of nondefense federal workers are furloughed . room for cuts . then there was this tweet : stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown . markets like being left alone for a day . then in 2017 as the president of the united states he tweeted : either elect more republican senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51 . our country needs a good shutdown in september to fix mess here s the real kicker , though . schumer offered trump his precious wall . he offered to put the border wall on the table , and trump still said no . also , it should be noted four senate republicans voted no on the measure friday night . twitter users went nuts over trump s most recent tweet . you can check out their responses below . featured image by mark wilson / getty images .
sunlight on africa , courtesy of trump january 25 , 2018 a disputed derogatory remark about the poor state of african countries attributed to president trump during a recent private oval office meeting between him and some members of the white house staff and congress sparked a global political , diplomatic and media firestorm . regardless of what may or may not have been said , the incident serves as a catalyst for inquisitive minds to put some much - needed sunlight on that continent ' s many problems . the african union - which represents 54 african member nations - immediately demanded the president retract his comment and apologize not only to africans but to all people of african descent around the globe - even though he disputed what was reportedly said along with several others in the meeting . it should not go unnoticed that the union ' s founder is libya ' s late dictator , moammar gadhafi - and the organization has colossally failed in its goal to seek " an integrated , prosperous and peaceful africa , driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena . " in reality , centuries of torment didn ' t end for most african people after they forced european colonialists to relinquish power in the mid - 20 th century . venal african leaders quickly filled the vacuum and have done little to develop their societies or emancipate africans from their horrid existence despite vast continental riches . worse yet , many of these leaders have enriched themselves at the expense of their countries by confiscating large amounts of wealth generated by private enterprises and foreign aid . freedom house ( a global freedom watchdog ) addressed africa ' s problems in an earlier report , laying the blame on kleptocracies , military dictatorships and single - party personalistic regimes dominating political systems and perpetuating the cycle of violence and debilitating poverty . its 2018 report on global freedom discloses that only 10 percent ( 126 . 3 million ) of africa ' s 1 . 2 billion residents live in freedom with the same political rights and civil liberties accorded to free world citizens . some startling facts emerge when one compares the conditions of africa ' s 1 . 2 billion residents to the 6 . 2 billion who populate other parts of the world . according to data contained in cia world factbook , the average life span of africans is 57 years , versus 71 years elsewhere . africa ' s gdp is 4 , 938 per capita ( distributed disproportionately between the well - to - do and the downtrodden ) , compared to the rest of the planet ' s 18 , 437 . and africa ' s illiteracy rate is 37 percent , more than four times greater than the illiteracy rate of 9 percent for the world ' s other residents . the relative short life span of africans is attributable to civil wars , genocide and anarchy that have plagued the continent for decades . angola , congo , libya , mozambique , nigeria , rwanda , somalia , and sudan exemplify the madness that has killed , displaced and terrorized tens of millions . disease is also a main factor , with the cia world factbook reporting some 945 million people in 36 african countries having a very high risk to major infectious diseases . the u . s . state department ' s 2017 trafficking in persons report provides more grim news for those who think slavery is a thing of the past . the report reveals that modern slavery ( compelled labor and / or sex trafficking ) is present in all 54 african countries , with 15 of them doing very little about it . in addition , libya and somalia are among the world ' s worst practitioners of modern day slavery . many of those captured in slavery ' s web are migrants looking for better lives away from their birth country . the u . s . state department ' s annual terrorism report for 2016 shows how the scourge of radical islamic terrorism has also gripped the african continent , with 15 such terror groups operating there . they include the notorious groups al qaeda ; al - shabab ; ansar al - shariah ; boko haram ; and the islamic state . these groups gestate and gain sympathy in most areas where islam flourishes . notably , islam ' s growing population now accounts for about 43 percent ( 523 million adherents ) of africa ' s population since the first muslims arrived in the continent during the 7 th century . the u . s . has made substantial efforts to assist the african people in coping with these problems since independence . it has diplomatic representation in nearly every country , contributes the greatest amount of its economic and development aid to that region and has about 6 , 000 troops posted there to enhance security . in recent years the u . s . has reportedly doubled the number of african immigrants entering the united states . in addition , one estimate pegs western nation investments at over 1 trillion for african development since its independence . the african union , united nations and others act as though mr . trump ' s alleged obscene description of african countries is worse than the vicious cycle of oppression , war , terrorism , genocide , poverty , illiteracy , slavery and disease that has plagued the continent for far too many years . the tens of millions of african lives that have been lost , displaced or ruined because african leaders haven ' t put the welfare of their people first , and that many of the organizations and programs created to benefit the long - suffering african people have failed are clearly worse than a simple word . mr . trump ' s critics should be mindful that long - standing african problems pre - date his presidency . moreover , they should appreciate his most sacred obligation to the american people is keeping them safe and asking honest and hard questions about the potential security and health risks posed to americans by immigrants ( legal / illegal ) entering the united states from dangerous parts of the world , including africa . hopefully the day will come when the african people are able to live in freedom , peace , harmony , good health and realize the continent ' s enormous potential . and when that day comes perhaps africans may decide to thank mr . trump for bringing much - needed attention to their current plight . a version of this piece also appeared on washington times
we hear quite a bit about survivors guilt these days . a neighbor s house has a tree through the roof , while yours was spared . a soldier walks behind another ; the one in the lead steps on a landmine , and the follower does not suffer loss of limbs . the hurricane skirts your hometown , and the adjoining county is hard hit . the rains come in due season to your land ; not too far away drought is ravaging crops . because you were born a buddhist in myanmar , you do not suffer the degradation of the rohingya people . survivors may be grateful for the good fortune they experienced , but they are wise to consider at what cost to others . it is hard not to construct a spared for a reason narrative ; however , it diminishes a sense of divine providence for those not spared . even more horrific is the disregard for the value of lives of a different ethnicity . survivors guilt is to be preferred over callous indifference , yet the sense of being specially blessed by god may lead to presumption . on sunday , the lesson from the hebrew bible was the story of israel crossing the red sea with the army of egypt in hot pursuit . written obviously from the perspective of the liberated , the story is grisly in detailing how the lord fought against egypt on behalf of israel . god instructs moses , stretch out your hand over the sea , so that the water may come back upon the egyptians , upon their chariots and chariot drivers ( exodus 14 : 26 ) . moses follows this directive , and the entire army is drowned . not one of them remained . the rabbis have long struggled with this text . god s preservation of the people of covenant seems to have blood cost . their further travel through the wilderness brings them to the land of promise , which is already occupied , a major inconvenience for both canaanites and israelites . more violence will ensue . codifying this narrative of election in scripture then extended to christians , many of whom became supersessionist , i . e . , arguing that now their election in christ eclipsed the jews . even when the humbler christian approach acknowledged that they have been grafted into god s enduring covenant with israel , this claim still argues for a preferential treatment that elevates this judeo - christian trajectory over against all the rest of the world s people . doctrines of election are a delicate matter , and it is hard to understand god s love of the whole world through the lens of particularity that the exodus story reveals . does divine favoritism not make it hard for outsiders to find their place in the story of liberation christians have always argued that the purpose of the abrahamic tradition of covenant was to bless the nations , as well as the historic people of god . some rabbis have suggested that the covenant with israel was an experiment in divine - human intimacy . would a people trust the holy one enough to follow instruction and live in faithful patterns of worship and justice could israel s experience of exodus become paradigmatic of god s salvific purpose for all as we struggled with this text in my sunday school class , an older man posed this question : so who are god s people i responded , everyone . the follow - up question in my mind was , when life is so hard , how do they know god is for them , that they are god s own this is where survivors come in , it seems to me . those who are spared must not simply rejoice in their seeming chosenness , but must use every resource to alleviate the suffering of others . guilt may not be the best source of motivation , but if it spurs compassion , it is constructive . christians believe that we come to know god s favor through christ and that he is the key to what god is doing throughout the world . what if the means through which god favors the suffering comes through those who already know of the expanse of god s election in him as kathryn tanner writes , through christ god gives the world god s very own life and saves us by establishing the closest possible relationship with us . the divine favor resting upon jesus is a gift for the whole world . just as blaming god for every cataclysmic event founders , so does expecting god to provide miraculously all the means of recovery . god always uses humanity in the redemptive project , and the only privilege christians have is their responsibility for acting in the name of the one they have come to know in jesus christ . this approach does not require triumphalistic swagger or a certitude that quashes other perceptions of truth . rather , it requires the humility of those called to participate with god in bringing this world to its true end . there is so much healing work to be done , and it is urgent .
the study of the hebrew language did not come easily to me . perhaps it was because i waited until my final year of seminary to take it ; perhaps it was because it met at 3 p . m . ; perhaps it was because i sat near a window ; perhaps it was because our professor was so bored teaching at this elementary level i am sure i can come up with some other excuses . i did pass , even making an a , but only because i memorized the book of jonah , a particular interest of our instructor . as i have been teaching my way through exodus with my sunday school class , i certainly wish i had loved the hebrew language more . i am sure that particular nuances elude me , yet translations do capture the richness of the narratives . specifically , i want to know more about the issue of testing . exodus itself is a patchwork of stories , which were gathered and edited over many years . these stories are complex reflections on how god s purpose will be accomplished with flawed human actors , and how human choices will impact the character of the divine . wandering , while being led it is very hard to map how the wilderness journey transpired , and clearly the people made the trek more difficult through obstinacy and lack of faith . the wilderness was a dangerous place , and the way god through moses led was open to suspicion . a frequent refrain of the congregation of israel was , have you brought us out here to kill us moses usually deflected and suggested that their complaint was against god , not him ( exodus 17 : 2 ) . because he claimed to be sent by god to shepherd this people , he had to take the heat . he was a convenient target like our pastors . god tested the people , and the people tested god . neither seemed pleased about this abrasion in their relationship , yet it was an unavoidable reality as a covenant was being forged in a context of peril . could god trust the people to follow the appointed leadership of moses could the people trust that they were accompanied by god s own presence their insistent question was , is the lord among us or not we can only imagine the ways in which that same query is being voiced in the daily heart - rending devastations . they found themselves at rephidim without water , and once again god provided through an unexpected means . god instructed moses to take his staff , the one he had used to turn the nile into blood , was now to provide life - giving water . god s own presence was in front of him at horeb , and through moses action of striking the rock , abundant water flowed . the place where this occurs portrays testing and quarreling , massah and meribah , and becomes a cautionary note about how not to behave toward god . israel s remarkable lack of faith was on display in full force . it seemed that moses believed that god had the right to test the people , but they should have refrained from testing god . after all , god has prerogatives that do not belong to human beings . brueggemann says that this text warns against a utilitarian view of god , in which the divine is judged by the desired outcomes for the asking community . in other words , human measures should not presume to assess the adequacy of god . dictating how god must respond reduces the sovereign one to our level , a risky proposition , indeed . while immanent among us , god is also working in ways that transcend our comprehension . jesus own experience in the wilderness raises this theological question once again . when the devil tempted him to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the temple in order to prove his identity in a spectacular way , jesus quoted , do not put the lord your god to the test ( deuteronomy 6 : 16 ) . the rest of the verse is as you did at massah . this faith venture is not easy , and we are beckoned to trust what we cannot see . walking by faith and not sight produces a bit of anxiety , even for the mature in christ . we echo the treasured words of thomas merton in thoughts in solitude : my lord , god , i have no idea where i am going . i do not see the road ahead of me . i cannot know for certain where it will end . thankfully , the one who was seen and touched by earliest believers , the very sacrament of god s presence with humanity , walks just ahead of us , marking out the pathway . it is this reality that leads merton to conclude his prayer with these words : therefore i will trust you always though i may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death . i will not fear , for you are ever with me , and you will never leave me to face my perils alone .
social media is blowing up about a culture of sexual harassment and assault . the sordid tale of harvey weinstein s pattern of predatory behavior against women has opened up a larger conversation about the almost universal experience of sexual exploitation of women . we have been ogled , called babes , touched without permission and raped . this does not just occur in the entertainment industry , but in every profession , including ministry . many clergywomen have voiced their experiences of violation , often perpetrated by friends in seminary , senior pastors and judicatory leaders many of whom were publicly affirming of women in ministry . baptists are not absent from this tale of abuse , and our refusal to talk about it forthrightly has only given license to predators . i am grateful that baptist women in ministry is working on a major project addressing sexual abuse . far too many of us have a story of unwanted attention and worse , usually entailing a major power differential . male colleagues have propositioned their female colleagues ; some male pastors have taken advantage of vulnerable counselees ; men have felt free to comment on women s appearance in a sexually suggestive way ; male professors have sought hugs and endearments from female graduate students or younger women colleagues ; and , women have been silenced when speaking about these behaviors . not surprising , the cycle has gone on . that is why so many baptist women in ministry are posting me , too . there have been some serial predators in moderate baptist circles , and only in conversation with other women in ministry have we discovered our similar stories of untoward actions by these men . they did not lose their ministerial credentials , and often they moved on to even more lucrative professional pursuits . experiences such as these bring shame to women , vocational redirection for some , and deepened awareness of how systems protect abusers . when a female pastor lodged a complaint about a pastoral colleague on the same staff ( multiple women of the church had complained of his behavior toward them ) , many of the congregation took his side and departed when he left . they believed him incapable of such , and they did not trust the word of the female pastor . why would she even need to bring it up , they wondered . patriarchy had certainly conditioned them to believe the male pastor instead of the female , even though she had higher rank on the pastoral staff . congregants were more upset with her for calling for the discipline of this minister than upset with him for his violation of ministry ethics . i have my own stories , as will many readers of this column . as a seminary student , a married doctoral student who was my greek instructor began to stop by my study carrel in the library , inviting me to go out with him . he would say things like , if only i had met you before i married , and other inappropriate things . i refused his invitations , and i am not sure if my grade was lowered from an a to an a - because of that . i was once invited for a weekend of preaching , and the pastor came to pick me up at the airport alone . i had thought his wife was coming , too . he kept asking if i wanted to go shopping or stop and get a drink . i managed to persuade him that i really needed to finish preparation for the varied events of the weekend . i kept my distance the rest of the weekend , making sure i was not alone with him . i later learned of other women who had experienced this kind of behavior and more from him . as more women enter the ranks of ministry , some men have reacted to what they see as a threatening incursion with renewed diminishment of women , often through sexualizing them inappropriately . women must call this out for what it is : predatory behavior . in a time when the president of the united states can brag about sexual assault , many men are emboldened to act on their worst impulses . i am thankful that many are speaking clearly about a culture of sexual predation . this conversation is hardly finished , and many are finding their voices .
many preachers took up the isaiah 55 passage this past sunday , proclaiming the abundant provision of god for all that sustains life . all you who are thirsty , come to the water you who have no money , come buy food , and eat come , buy wine and milk , without money , without price the invitation is almost too good to be true who gets to purchase the finest food and drink without ever pulling out the credit card not only does the prophet speak of the basic physical nourishment we require , but also speaks of listening to god that your soul may live ( 55 : 3 b ) . many live unaware that our deepest longings go beyond what we eat and drink ; hunger and thirst for the holy one are inscribed into every human being . the problem is that we forget , over and over . this portion of isaiah announces that the time of desolation is over and that god may be sought and found ( v . 6 ) . god promises abundance , and renewal will come to a place covered with briers and thorns . myrtle and cypress trees will flourish , and they will signal god s goodness and restorative power . the landscape will mirror the renewing work god will do with the covenant people . as irenaeus wrote , the glory of god is humanity fully alive . weariness with life stalks many in our time , and rather than turning to the source of renewal , we often simply numb ourselves with food that does not satisfy or distracting entertainment . recently we have been shocked by the social media fueled suicide of an adolescent boy , goaded by the promptings of an adolescent girl . teenage suicide is on the rise ( and it is not just boys ) , and one cannot help but wonder at the level of emptiness so many experience . the incessant postings of peers who seem , by comparison , to have more friends , fun and family leaves others with a sense of diminishment that cannot be surmounted . god s invitation is nothing less than a beckoning to receive what god alone can provide : grace . grace receives us as we are and renews the human spirit . grace reminds us of who we are created to be and supplies the enervating work of the spirit that we might fully live . without grace , despair eclipses hope , and persons wonder if they can endure . i have just enjoyed the extravagance of two weeks away in the mountains of northern new mexico . the idlewild community , near eagle nest , provides a preacher cabin for visiting ministers . if you preach at the worship service , you have the privilege of staying in this rustic setting for the better part of a week . since i preached two sundays , i got to stay a bit longer . i am grateful that my school encouraged this investment of time , and i trust my soul will live with a greater sense of abundance . the first word of the rule of st . benedict is listen , and this is what i have attempted to do in this time . i have listened to rushing streams flowing over creek stones ; i have listened to wind ruffling wild flowers ; i have listened to mule deer stirring in the brush ; i have listened to rain on a tin roof ; i have listened to bats squeaking under the eaves ; i have listened to scripture ; and , i have listened to the sound of a fine silence , as elijah testified . god has spoken through these media , and it has been good . most important has been an attentiveness to grace that is an intrinsic part of sabbath . wendell berry says this of sabbath : the field is tilled and left to grace . recognizing the limitation of effort and the need for rest requires a level of relinquishment , which most of us resist . meister eckhart used the concept of seinlassen in his mystical writings ; it is an attitude of letting be , of being in a state of receptivity to what might be born through us . he encourages humans to become the silent place of god s presence . tethered to our devices , we presume that if we go off the grid dire things may happen . i had little wi - fi connectivity in the preacher s cabin , and wonder of wonders , my school , church and family all survived just fine in my absence . humility trusts that god s grace will produce harvest even when our labor is suspended . the word shabbat comes from the root shin - bet - tav , meaning to cease . the sabbath keeps the people more than people keep the sabbath , as the jewish adage reminds us . soon the rhythms of summer will be behind us , and the regularity of academic and ecclesial schedules will order our days and weeks . the memory of this time of renewal will linger , i trust , and remind me to return to the source of life , where one may drink deeply . god s invitation is ever present , and abundant grace is offered .
clinton obama emails : the key to understanding why hillary wasn ' t indicted january 24 , 2018 new fbi texts highlight a motive to conceal the president ' s involvement . from the first , these columns have argued that the whitewash of the hillary clinton - emails caper was president barack obama ' s call - not the fbi ' s , and not the justice department ' s . ( see , e . g . , here , here , and here . ) the decision was inevitable . obama , using a pseudonymous email account , had repeatedly communicated with secretary clinton over her private , non - secure email account . these emails must have involved some classified information , given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state , the broad outlines of obama ' s own executive order defining classified intelligence ( see eo 13526 , section 1 . 4 ) , and the fact that the obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the clinton - obama emails . if classified information was mishandled , it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges . if clinton had been charged , obama ' s culpable involvement would have been patent . in any prosecution of clinton , the clinton - obama emails would have been in the spotlight . for the prosecution , they would be more proof of willful ( or , if you prefer , grossly negligent ) mishandling of intelligence . more significantly , for clinton ' s defense , they would show that obama was complicit in clinton ' s conduct yet faced no criminal charges . that is why such an indictment of hillary clinton was never going to happen . the latest jaw - dropping disclosures of text messages between fbi agent peter strzok and his paramour , fbi lawyer lisa page , illustrate this point . for the moment , i want to put aside the latest controversy - the fbi ' s failure to retain five months of text messages between strzok and page , those chattiest of star - crossed lovers . yes , this " glitch " closes our window on a critical time in the trump - russia investigation : mid december 2016 through mid may 2017 . that is when the bureau and justice department were reportedly conducting and renewing ( in 90 - day intervals ) court - approved fisa surveillance that may well have focused on the newly sworn - in president of the united states . ( remember : the bureau ' s then - director , james comey , testified at a march 20 house intelligence committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with trump ' s campaign and kremlin interference in the election . ) the retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap . assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate , bureau - wide problem - that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the trump - russia investigation - it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention . but it is not inconceivable . attorney general jeff sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway , so let ' s assume ( for argument ' s sake , at least ) that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their non - retention will be forthcoming . for now , let ' s stick with the clinton - obama emails . only july 5 , 2016 , comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing mrs . clinton ' s criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment . we now know that comey ' s remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers . this past weekend , in a letter to the fbi regarding the missing texts , senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson ( r . , wis . ) addressed some of these revisions . according to senator johnson , a draft dated june 30 , 2016 ( i . e . , five days before comey delivered the final version ) , contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between clinton and obama . ( i note that the fbi ' s report of its eventual interview of clinton contains a cryptic reference to a july 1 , 2012 , email that clinton sent from russia to obama ' s email address . see report , page 2 . ) the passage in the june 30 draft stated : we also assess that secretary clinton ' s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent . she also used her personal email extensively while outside the united states , including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries . that use included an email exchange with the president while secretary clinton was on the territory of such an adversary . [ emphasis added . ] given that combination of factors , we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton ' s personal email account . on the same day , according to a strzok - page text , a revised draft of comey ' s remarks was circulated by his chief of staff , jim rybicki . it replaced " the president " with " another senior government official . " this effort to obscure obama ' s involvement had an obvious flaw : it would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the " senior government official " with whom clinton had exchanged emails . that was not going to work . consequently , by the time comey delivered his remarks on july 5 , the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to obama . instead , all the stress was placed on clinton ( who was not going to be charged anyway ) for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services . comey made no reference to clinton ' s correspondent : we also assess that secretary clinton ' s use of a personal e - mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent . she also used her personal e - mail extensively while outside the united states , including sending and receiving work - related e - mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries . [ emphasis added . ] given that combination of factors , we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton ' s personal e - mail account . the decision to purge any reference to obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment clinton ' s use of a private , non - secure server system was revealed in early march 2015 . i detailed this reaction in a series of 2016 columns ( see , e . g . , here and here ) . what most alarmed obama and clinton advisers ( those groups overlap ) was not only that there were several clinton - obama email exchanges , but also that obama dissembled about his knowledge of clinton ' s private email use in a nationally televised interview . on march 4 , just after the new york times broke the news about clinton ' s email practices at the state department , john podesta ( a top obama adviser and clinton ' s campaign chairman ) emailed cheryl mills ( clinton ' s confidant and top aide in the obama state department ) to suggest that clinton ' s " emails to and from potus " should be " held " - i . e . , not disclosed - because " that ' s the heart of his exec privilege . " at the time , the house committee investigating the benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of clinton ' s emails . as his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in clinton ' s misconduct , obama deceptively told cbs news in a march 7 interview that he had found out about clinton ' s use of personal email to conduct state department business " the same time everybody else learned it through news reports . " perhaps he was confident that , because he had used an alias in communicating with clinton , his emails to and from her - estimated to number around 20 - would remain undiscovered . his and clinton ' s advisers were not so confident . right after the interview aired , clinton campaign secretary josh scherwin emailed jennifer palmieri and other senior campaign staffers , stating : " jen you probably have more on this but it looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it on the news . " scherwin ' s alert was forwarded to mills . shortly afterwards , an agitated mills emailed podesta : " we need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state . gov . " ( that is , obama had emails from clinton , which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in " state . gov " as state department emails do . ) so how did obama and his helpers " clean this up " obama had his email communications with clinton sealed . he did this by invoking a dubious presidential - records privilege . the white house insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails , of course ; rather , it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers . with the media content to play along , this had a twofold benefit : obama was able ( 1 ) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and ( 2 ) to avoid using the term " executive privilege " - with all its dark watergate connotations - even though that was precisely what he was invoking . note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions . but of course , that ' s not a problem if there will be no prosecution . the white house purported to repair the president ' s disingenuous statement in the cbs interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of clinton ' s homebrew server system through news reports - he hadn ' t meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email . this was sheer misdirection : from obama ' s standpoint , the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account ; the fact that , in addition , clinton ' s private email account was connected to her own private server system , rather than some other private email service , was beside the point . but , again , the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the white house ' s non - explanation . meanwhile , attorney general loretta lynch ordered comey to use the word " matter " rather than " investigation " to describe the fbi ' s probe of clinton ' s email practices . this ensured that the democratic administration ' s law - enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the democratic candidate ' s campaign rhetoric . if there was no investigation , there would be no prosecution . in april 2016 , in another nationally televised interview , obama made clear that he did not want clinton to be indicted . his rationale was a legally frivolous straw man : clinton had not intended to harm national security . this was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed ; nor was it in dispute . no matter : obama ' s analysis was the stated view of the chief executive . if , as was sure to happen , his subordinates in the executive law - enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view , there would be no prosecution . within a few weeks , even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses - including clinton herself - had not yet been interviewed , the fbi began drafting comey ' s remarks that would close the investigation . there would be no prosecution . on june 27 , lynch met with clinton ' s husband , former president bill clinton , on an out - of - the - way arizona tarmac , where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked . over the next few days , the fbi took pains to strike any reference to obama ' s emails with mrs . clinton from the statement in which comey would effectively end the " matter " with no prosecution . on july 1 , amid intense public criticism of her meeting with bill clinton , attorney general lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the fbi director and career prosecutors made about charging clinton . as page told strzok in a text that day , " this is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu . " it was also playacting . page elaborated that the attorney general already " knows no charges will be brought . " of course she did : it was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution . knowing that , lynch had given the fbi notice on june 30 that she ' d be announcing her intention to accept comey ' s recommendation . fearing this just might look a bit choreographed , the fbi promptly amended comey ' s planned remarks to include this assertion ( which he in fact made on july 5 ) : " i have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice or any other part of the government . they do not know what i am about to say . " but they did not need to participate in drafting the statement , and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use . it was not comey ' s decision anyway . all they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution . on july 2 , with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made , mrs . clinton sat for an interview with the fbi - something she ' d never have done if there were a chance she might be charged . the farce was complete with the justice department and fbi permitting two subjects of the investigation - mills and clinton aide heather samuelson - to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing clinton . that is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case . here , however , it was clear : there would be no prosecution . all cleaned up : no indictment , meaning no prosecution , meaning no disclosure of clinton - obama emails . it all worked like a charm . . . except the part where mrs . clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again . a version of this piece also appeared on national review online .
a trip to the cardiologist is rarely routine . usually a precipitating episode or a prior procedure prompts the appointment , and we are eager to receive a reassuring assessment . we know that the condition of the heart determines our health , and we listen with rapt attention to learn how we are really doing . this past winter while teaching at conception abbey , i had a viral infection that mimicked some sort of heart trouble . being taken to the infirmary in a male monastery was exciting for all concerned monks and patient alike . i got to see parts of the monastery that are off - limits for women , so i dutifully closed my eyes ( well , most of the time ) . thankfully , all checked out well after a trip to a regional hospital and a follow - up with my cardiologist . truly , i gained a new appreciation for my heart . the bible speaks of the heart frequently , making it the most common anthropological term in the scripture . it is the vital center of a person , and it supplies the nourishment that is life - giving . in our time , we think the brain to be the center of human activity , directing the rhythms of an individual s body ; from the ancients viewpoint , the heart was the central organ that moved the rest of the body . scripture also speaks of the heart as the source of emotional , intellectual and moral activities . thus , it plays a significant role in spiritual health , as the heart gathers up one s whole being . it is the locus of faith ; it orients a person s life , and we should be wary of giving our heart to other than god . as martin luther said , belief is that upon which we lean our heart . the gospel reading for this coming sunday includes the parable of the sower . jesus speaks of varied responses to the word of the coming reign of god , and he warns how hard it is to be faithful to it , for the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word , and it yields nothing ( matthew 13 : 22 ) . the word intends to rehabilitate the human heart , which can be hardened , wicked , godless , in biblical parlance . when one broadcasts seed rather than carefully spaced planting , seeds can end up in varied contexts . good soil can encourage growth , but rocky soil or a thorny patch or a trodden path make it very hard for the seed to bear plentiful yields . varied elements conspire to keep the seed ( the word ) from accomplishing its true intent , to renew the heart by grace . responding to the word of god is not an easy thing , for it puts us at odds with the dominant culture of our world , which is all about acquisition , comfort and personal security . jesus warns that the claim of this word is difficult : when anyone hears the word of the basileia ( the reign of god ) and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart ( v . 19 ) . consumerist christianity has performed a convenient work - around so as to ease the burden of jesus claim . we have relegated his warning to the status of interim ethics . jesus could only expect his followers to be radical in their fidelity because the world would soon end ; he would return and rescue them from the challenge of living in a world of competing claims . he surely could not have meant for people to live in the economics of grace long term . wallace hartsfield ii suggests to his preaching students at our seminary that one who proclaims must find the original claim of the text on the hearer , the claim for the hearer today and the claim upon the preacher . this parable would make more sense in an agricultural setting ; however , its pungent insights remain and call hearers of the word to examine their response and think about what issues forth from the heart , as well its chief longing . i recently had the opportunity to write a blurb for an important book authored by elizabeth hinson - hasty . in her forthcoming text , the problem of wealth , she challenges assumptions about why people are in poverty and calls for a new vision of community requiring economic justice . by delineating the problem when theology and economics are not integrally related , she is echoing the teaching of the parable . wealth is the problem , she contends , for it tramples compassion for the economic other . once again , it is a matter of the heart . when the word of god takes lodging in our hearts , we are beckoned toward generative living , little satisfied with only the world s goods . where the heart is located and what fruit it bears makes all the difference for the treasure that is god s emerging reign .

" we know we have to address some issues that relate to border security and we hope that we can do that in very short order , " said pelosi , adding that " we take hope in the commitment of president donald trump " to sign any legislation brought to his desk . " we are proud to be with our dreamers , who make america more american , with the hope , the determination , the optimism , the insistence on making the future better for the next generation . those are american traits . " in his remarks , rodriguez , who gave a prayer at trump ' s inauguration , explained that president trump cares about the well - being of the children of illegal immigrants and wants to sign legislation securing their legal status . expand collapse ( screenshot : youtube / washington post ) the reverend samuel rodriguez , president of the national hispanic christian leadership conference , giving remarks at a press conference on the future of dreamers . " the president wants to make this happen . he wants to make this happen . he ' s a grandfather and a father . he has expressed that to me personally in the white house : ' i don ' t want to harm these kids . i want to make this happen , ' " said rodriguez . rodriguez also spoke about the " clarion call " for border security coming from both the white house and the republican - controlled congress . " the wall is a physical object created by man . 800 , 000 human beings created in the image of god by god , " noted rodriguez . " so if we have to build a wall in order to secure and save 800 , 000 lives , let ' s make that happen as expeditiously as possible . . . let ' s build a wall , simultaneously saving 800 , 000 kids . " also in attendance for the press conference were bishop harry jackson , senior pastor of hope christian church , and congresswoman michelle lujan grisham ( d - nm ) , chairwoman of the congressional hispanic caucus . last september , the trump administration announced that they were rescinding the obama - era daca program , which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the united states illegally when they were children . in a statement read to the press , u . s . attorney general jeff sessions announced that daca was being " rescinded " as it was viewed as an unlawful unilateral action on the part of the previous administration . " this policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens , " stated sessions . " in other words , the executive branch , through daca , deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions . such an open - ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch . " the full rescinding of daca was given a six - month delay so that congress could pass legislation on behalf of those , commonly called dreamers , threatened with deportation once the program was gone . earlier this month , federal judge william alsup of san francisco issued a temporary block to the administration ' s ending of daca , arguing that the department of homeland security ' s " decision to rescind daca was based on a flawed legal premise . " " as a result , daca recipients who failed to renew their status by last year ' s deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications . the decision does not , however , allow new applications to be submitted , " reported the hill . johnnie moore , a religious freedom advocate and evangelical leader with strong ties to the trump administration , helped to organize the press conference . in a statement posted to twitter , moore explained that " nearly every republican , as well as potus himself , believe this is the just thing to do . " " it is the job of congress to make laws not according to their opinions but the opinions of their constituents . our system demands compromise . we encourage pray for a dacadeal , " added moore .

" further investigation revealed several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul - smelling surroundings , but the parents were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner , " police said in a press release . what was even more shocking , they say , was that seven of the 13 victims who ranged in age from 2 to 29 were adults 18 and older . an official with knowledge of the case told nbc news that the four - bedroom home where they lived was like a prison and reeked of urine . all of the children are reportedly being treated for severe malnutrition at local hospitals and doctors are worried they could go into shock . as soon as their conditions improve , psychologists are expected to be brought in to evaluate them . david turpin ' s 81 - year - old mother , betty turpin , said it ' s difficult to believe what was happening in her son ' s house because she felt he and his wife were " model christians .

( photo : reuters / tony gentile ) pope francis leads his wednesday general audience at paul vi auditorium hall in vatican city february 8 , 2017 . pope francis has dismissed out of touch pastors leading double lives as a " wound " to the church which parishioners should not emulate . " it ' s bad to see pastors with double lives . it ' s a wound to the church . sick pastors , who have lost authority and carry on with this double life . jesus is stern with them . he not only tells people not to listen to them but also to not do what they do . what does he tell them ' you ' re white sepulchers . ' beautiful in doctrine on the outside , but rotting within , " francis said in a strongly - worded homily at casa santa marta on jan . 9 . the pope warned that when pastors begin to lead double lives it is usually a symptom that their prayer life is weak and they have lost touch with the people they are supposed to be serving . " this is the end of a pastor who is neither close to god in prayer nor close to the people in compassion , " he said . in november , francis highlighted how jesus warned his disciples about the scribes and pharisees who " tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on people ' s shoulders , but they will not lift a finger to move them . " " this attitude is a wicked exercise of authority , " he said , noting that spiritual leaders should lead by good example , " helping others practice what is right and due , supporting them in the trials that they encounter on the path of goodness . " when authority is exercised badly , the pope explained , " it becomes oppressive , it does not allow people to grow and it creates a climate of distrust and of hostility , and also brings corruption . " the pope ' s warning at the time came in light of a report that indonesian bishop hubertus leteng had been accused by dozens of priests in the diocese of ruteng of having a mistress and misusing over 120 , 000 in church funds . he later resigned from his post . the pontiff urged pastors who have lost their authority to not lose hope like the high priest eli in the bible . despite the failure of his two sons , hophni and phinehas , to live a life of righteousness , eli still allowed them to serve as priests in the tabernacle which angered god and the people of israel . " i say to the pastors who are detached from god and from the people , ' don ' t lose hope . there ' s always another possibility . it was enough for a man to look and approach a woman , listen to her and awaken the authority to bless and prophecy . " accordingly , a son was born to her . authority . authority , a gift from god . it only comes from him . jesus gives it to his own . authority in speaking , which comes from closeness to god and to the people . they always go together . authority is coherence , not double life . it ' s authority , and if a pastor loses it , he should not lose hope , like eli . there ' s always time to come close and reawaken authority and prophecy , " francis said .
( photo : baltimore ravens ) baltimore ravens tight end benjamin watson points to the sky during an nfl pre - season game in this undated file photo from 2016 . baltimore ravens tight end and pending free agent benjamin watson needed just two words to slam the nation ' s largest abortion provider for quoting the words of dr . martin luther king jr . , one of the most revered civil rights activists of the 1960 s . on martin luther king day monday , planned parenthood , much like many other organizations in the united states , posted a tribute to the slain minister on its facebook page . planned parenthood shared a picture of king that features the word " dream " in big white lettering . along with the picture , the abortion chain quoted king as saying : " our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . " " today , we remember dr king ' s legacy of resistance and commit to carrying the torch of courageous vision and action towards justice and equity . mlkday , " the planned parenthood post reads . the post by planned parenthood , which performs over 300 , 000 abortions every year and has been accused of unfairly targeting african - american and minority communities , didn ' t sit well with watson , a devout christian who has voiced his pro - life beliefs many times in the past . watson shared the planned parenthood post on his own facebook page and offered two words in response : " just stop . " the post comes as watson gears up to speak to christians gathered in washington , d . c . , this week for the annual evangelicals for life conference , hosted by the southern baptist convention ' s ethics religious liberty commission . in august 2016 , watson made national headlines after it was reported that he told turning point pregnancy resource center in an interview that planned parenthood was created to " exterminate " african - americans . " i do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions , and i do know that honestly the whole idea with planned parenthood and [ founder margaret ] sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks , and it ' s kind of ironic that it ' s working , " watson said . " we [ as minorities ] support candidates , and overwhelmingly support the idea of having planned parenthood and the like , and yet , that is why she created it . " watson also seemingly criticized minorities for buying into the abortion agenda . " we are buying it hook , line , and sinker , like it ' s a great thing . it ' s just amazing to me and abortion saddens me , period , " watson explained . " but it seems to be something that is really pushed on minorities and provided to minorities especially as something that they should do . in the public , it seems to be painted that when minorities get pregnant they need to get abortions , especially when it comes to teen pregnancy . " " it ' s like when black girls are pregnant , it ' s like a statistic , but when white girls get pregnant , they get a tV show , " he added . last january , watson spoke to marchers at the 2017 march for life . at the event , watson called on those in attendance to make an impact within their own sphere of influence . " this is the power of one . it is the power of influence , to influence people in our neighborhoods in our churches , in our workplaces on our teams , " watson said . " it is also the power to unite as we have today as one , for a common cause to end the unthinkable practice of abortion in america . " " to be pro - life should be all encompassing , from conception to the grave . "
reuters / suhaib salem palestinian children watch worshippers as they attend orthodox christian palm sunday mass at the saint porfirios church in gaza city april 5 , 2015 . the number of christians living in the gaza strip has massively declined , church leaders have warned , hailing believers who choose to stay behind despite the hardships as being " real heroes . " bishop oscar cantu of las cruces , new mexico , told catholic news service earlier this week that people in the region are barely " scrapping by " because the area has been blockaded by israel since hamas , a terrorist group , controls the government . what is more , only 130 roman catholic parishioners remain in gaza , while not long ago there were 1 , 700 , he said . " the numbers of christians in gaza is dropping precipitously . it is just sad to hear , because obviously there is little to no opportunity for young people . there is little encouragement for them to stay , " cantu said . several church leaders celebrated mass at holy family parish in gaza on sunday , as part of the annual holy land coordination , where bishops from around the world meet with israeli and palestinian groups in an effort to promote peace . archbishop stephen brislin of cape town , south africa , said it is understandable why many people are leaving gaza , despite reconstruction work that ' s been ongoing since the 2014 conflict . " the young people feel they must decide between staying in gaza or leaving to find schools and jobs in other parts of the world , " brislin told cns . " this affects the christian community . the young people who stay in gaza are the real heroes . they are willing to sacrifice in order to create families and christian life in gaza . " the challenges are massive , however , as young people face nearly 70 percent unemployment in gaza . still , brislin said it ' s imperative that the christian community continues to exist in gaza , which is known in the bible as one of the places the holy family passed through on their way to egypt . " basically , people are imprisoned . it can feel very claustrophobic . . . for young people with a lot of dreams and hopes and potentials . and these potentials are broken because of the lack of opportunities , " the archbishop warned . christians in gaza have often found themselves caught in the crossfire of the israeli and palestinian conflict , and have also faced struggles against the muslim majority in the area . hundreds of believers staged protests in 2012 , reuters reports , and blamed hamas - affiliated groups of kidnapping members of the christian community and forcing them to convert to islam . recently , many muslims and christians in gaza came together to protest against u . s . president donald trump ' s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel ' s capital , al jazeera , a news outlet controlled by the qatari government , reported . " everyone we have spoken to here is in opposition to the u . s . move , and they say it only adds to the frustration of life here , " al jazeera reported . trump ' s move sparked praise from many israeli religious leaders , but was met with strong opposition from the arab world .
( photo : reuters / brian snyder ) demonstrators holding an " interfaith prayer vigil for immigrant justice " talk to ethnic chinese christians who fled indonesia after wide scale rioting decades ago and overstayed their visas in the u . s . , following their family meeting , including their five year - old daughter ( r ) , with icE , in manchester , new hampshire , u . s . , october 13 , 2017 . the plight of around 50 indonesian christians living in the u . s . but threatened with deportations by the administration of president donald trump has been likened by a federal judge to jewish people fleeing the nazis in world war ii . " we ' re not going to be that country , " judge patti b . saris said on wednesday at a hearing in u . s . district court in boston . " we don ' t want to put them on the ship unless someone " can review their contention that deportation back to indonesia is " a really bad situation for them , " she added , according to the boston globe . saris was referencing a case in 1939 when an ocean liner filled with 937 passengers , mostly jews , left germany for america , but was turned away by government officials . hundreds of those jews were reporedly later killed during the holocaust . saris has ruled in favor of the christians on a number of occasions against the trump administration , and in november said that immigration officials do not have the right to carry out immediate deportations . the believers fear that they will face persecution , torture , and possibly death if they are sent back home to the world ' s largest muslim nation . most of the indonesians came to the u . s . in the late 1990 s and 2000 s , fleeing anti - christian violence . although many overstayed their visas , u . s . authorities allowed them to stay based on certain conditions , such as checking in regularly . they have been caught up in the net of trump ' s crackdown on illegal immigration , however , and in august immigration officials told them they only have 30 days to get a plane ticket and depart the country . attorneys for the christians are arguing that their clients deserve the right to at least challenge the deportation orders , and raise their fears of persecution with the board of immigration appeals . the justice department has argued that the indonesians have not proven that they are likely to face persecution or torture if they are sent back home , however . " their assertion that ' all face a significant risk of persecution and torture if removed to indonesia ' is unsupported by facts that relate to any specific petitioner , " doj lawyers have said . democratic sen . jeanne shaheen , who brokered the deal in 2009 that allowed the christians to stay in seacoast communities in new hampshire , has insisted that they do face significant religious persecution back home . " deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities , and put lives in danger . i ' ll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in new hampshire , " shaheen said last year . meldy lumangkun , one indonesian christian , told icE officials in manchester that there is also concern for the children . " we are afraid to go home . we fear for the safety of our children , " lumangkun explained . " here our children can live safely . "
( photos : screen shot via youtube ; h m ; instagram ) leader of baltimore ' s empowerment temple church , jamal bryant . more than a week after instagram deleted a post from megachurch pastor jamal bryant for not " promoting harmony " because he urged a boycott of swedish clothing retail giant h m over racist advertising , an official from facebook , which owns the application , said it was a " mistake . " " we mistakenly removed the content and worked to rectify the mistake as soon as we were notified , " an instagram spokesperson told the christian post in a statement late thursday . the empowerment temple church leader and social activist revealed in a video he posted on his facebook page on jan . 8 that he took umbrage to h m ' s use of a black boy to model a sweatshirt with the slogan " coolest monkey in the jungle " that was featured on the company ' s u . k . website and decided to join in a growing protest against the company for their insensitivity . " i immediately at 6 o ' clock this morning ( jan . 8 ) en route to the gym , posted on instagram . that every person who is of conscience no matter what your color , should in fact be boycotting h m because they do not appreciate our dollars and don ' t understand our depth and don ' t think highly enough of us to put us on their board of directors . boycotth m , " bryant said in the video . facebook also never had an african - american on its board until it announced thursday that it will bring kenneth chenault , the ceo of american express , onto its board . after about 4 , 000 people had approved his message on the social platform , bryant said instagram sent him a note saying : " we have taken the liberty to delete your post because it does not promote harmony . " a more diplomatic version of bryant ' s controversial post is currently live on his instagram page . many high profile public figures such as Nba star lebron james and rapper diddy have voiced their disapproval of the h m advertisement . singer abel makkonen tesfaye , popularly known as " the weeknd , " has canceled his partnership with the company . there has been intense global backlash over the advertising . at least two h m outlets in south africa were trashed by the opposition economic freedom fighters party during anti - racism protests that forced the company to close all of its stores in that country on saturday . a fortune report said the company announced annie wu as their new global leader for diversity and inclusiveness on tuesday . she was already the global manager for employee relations . " the recent incident was entirely unintentional , but it demonstrates so clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand , " h m said in a message on instagram . " our commitment to addressing diversity and inclusiveness is genuine , therefore we have appointed a global leader , in this area , to drive our work forward . " bryant charged , however , that despite the company ' s apology , it has no real commitment to diversity and inclusion . " don ' t walk away from h m just for today . shut the door , " he told his supporters . " save your apology h m . the reason why it is that you are able to do it with clear conscience is that you are developing , you are manufacturing , you are warehousing , you are shipping all at the hands of black people but on your board of 12 , you have not one minority sitting on your board .

monsanto has really gotten brave when it comes to what they think they can get away with . monsanto has become the most inconsistent , public betraying , and health neglecting food companies in the entire world , and it is time to shut them down . i m sure each person reading this article has already read one or more articles about something monsanto has done to the public . they genetically modify organisms and poison the people . monsanto should ve been shut down years ago , but now they really should . we know that monsanto won t be shut down though because they are among the chains of companies that rule the entire world . recently , some really interesting things were released about monsanto and they are literally scrambling to bury it . be sure to share so that monsanto can be exposed once and for all . the fda registered food safety laboratory tested iconic american food for residues of monsanto s weed killer glyphosate . this chemical is also known as round - up . following the tests they found incredible amounts of this dangerous chemical in all kinds of foods many of the foods were found to have over 1 , 000 times the safe amount here are the results . it is really upsetting that we have to discuss the dangers of this chemical . but of course , some people will deny our integrity and assume that this chemical is harmless . glyphosate is terrible for humans . it is weed killer , of course . glyphosate has even been linked to cancer . in 2015 , the world health organization declared the chemical as probably carcinogenic to humans . the observation was based on animal tests , test tube studies , and observational studies . mice and rat studies showed that the chemical produced the growth of tumors after the ingestion of the chemical . a few of the cases were even linked to non - hodgkin lymphoma , a cancer that originates in white blood cells . this cancer cripples the immune system and will leave you for dead . are we really okay will eating foods that are so likely to cause such a disease the word is being ran by money hungry CEo s , and they are neglecting our health . stand up to monsanto image via business insider
we have all been affected by cancer in some way or another . we share information almost daily about how to cure it and the things that cause it but could the cure to cancer really be this simple according to gregg braden , an american author when it comes to cancer therapy our minds play a much bigger role than we would initially think . how we feel significantly affects our Dna . he suggests that through the power of collective thought we could have a positive effect in treating all sorts of diseases , not just cancer . right off the bat , you may think this sounds like a load of bullshit and i could see why . however , this theory does not push that you need to be religious in order to do this , a matter of face you do not have to be religious at all for this to work . braden believes there is a field that unites everything . this field he is referring to is one that has been scientifically proven and explained in the science journal nature no . 332 back in 1996 . now many are still quite skeptical about this but the video below as you will see shows this theory in action . in the video , you can see plain as day cancer being eliminated in about three minutes or less . the whole process is demonstrated over an ultrasound screen and is quite interesting to watch . braden says this works because of the strong electromagnetic radiation being produced during the video . he says that if you want to be able to do this yourself you will need to learn to focus and enhance your effects . this is something he claims lots of practice can show you how to do . what do you think about this could positive thinking really be a cure or is this a load of bologna

an egg inside an egg . sounds tasty doesn t when one couple gathered some eggs from their hen , they came across a very large egg . it turned out that the egg was large for a good reason it had another egg inside it . the video below shows the actual footage of what happens when the large egg is cracked open . in addition to a yoke and a white that you would normally see when you crack an egg , you see an entirely separate egg complete and still in its shell . the egg owner is intrigued and goes on to opening the extra egg to see what s inside it . it turns out this is a normal egg with the yolk and white intact . apparently , there is a name for such a phenomenon and an egg inside an egg is known as a counter - peristalsis contraction , which means that the egg that had already gone through the hen s oviduct gets sucked back up before it has a chance to finish developing , thus allowing another egg to develop around it . sometimes , if you have another ovulation before the first egg is laid , you have a counter - peristalsis contraction , which means the oviduct will contract upward , and the first egg will be moved back up , poultry science editor gregory bedecarats said . when you see a tiny egg incorporated in a larger one , it means the egg was still present in the shell gland and got sucked back up the oviduct to where the other egg was having its white deposited . the result is a mega - egg . the owner of the hen that laid this egg was worried that the hen didn t die when the egg was coming out . because all those who were present for the big mega - egg reveal were too scared to eat the egg , the wife used it as an ingredient in her hair conditioner . commenters felt sorry for the hen that had to push the mega - egg out poor chicken that had to push that monster out hahaha . and they certainly found the humor in the case of the massive egg well , the question which came first : the chicken or the egg should wait a little bit longer . evidently , eggs aren t the only thing that comes in doubles i have seen that happen once before when my aunt had chickens . also , cut a bell pepper open once and there was another tiny , fully formed , bell pepper inside it . when the family cracks open the egg it looks a bit like one of those russian nesting dolls . one commenter had a decent explanation for the rare incident
did you ever stop and think about where pumpkin pie originally came from there is really no time like the week of thanksgiving to dabble in these types of thoughts , which is why you are about to be enlightened by the truth behind that classic pumpkin pie holiday dish . believe it or not , it wasn t your grandmother who came up with the tasty dessert . while she may not like the fact that she is no longer deserving of the credit , rest assured , the original pumpkin pie was made far differently than the one that we know today . and it was invented by the pilgrims today , pumpkin pie looks like any other pie , brimming with a tasty filling and topped with sweet whipped cream . it s top is smooth , its crust is hearty and it simply looks delicious . but , when the pilgrims first made this holiday favorite , it looked a lot different than what we know today . instead of a smooth pie exterior , the recipe of the past looked more like a pie , literally inside a pumpkin . if you feel like getting in touch with history this thanksgiving , you can try out the pilgrims version of pumpkin pie - first , you are going to get a pie pumpkin . these aren t your average carving pumpkins , instead they are a little bit flatter , with grooves on the outside . they are also known as sugar pumpkins , and are smaller in shape than the monstrous pumpkins you d find at your typical pumpkin patch . pie pumpkins are commonly found in the grocery store in the produce section or at farm stands . this small , round pumpkin is packed full of flesh that makes it a good choice for cooking . the pulp also has a better texture , is sweeter , and a lot less grainy . - slice off the top of the pumpkin and clean out the inside , scooping diligently with your hand until it s free of the guts and seeds . - set the pumpkin on a cookie sheet and cover with foil . you will then bake it at 400 degrees until it s tender . a fork should easily be able to cut through the outside . a 15 pound pumpkin takes two hours to reach tender status , so do the math and bake accordingly . now , it s time to make the custard . for this , you will need - 8 eggs - 1 cup brown sugar - 1 1 / 4 teaspoon pumpkin spice - 2 cans of evaporated milk ( 24 ounces ) - whisk all custard ingredients together , until smooth and blended . it will be a liquid consistency . - use a ladle to remove any excess liquid from the inside of the pumpkin - pour the custard into the inside of the pumpkin . - lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake the pumpkin for one hour or until the custard firms up . your end result should look like your pie pumpkin on the outside . when you cut into it , you will surprise your guests with a tasty custard filling . it definitely looks more festive than the pumpkin pies that we ve been raised to know . maybe you will bring back an old classic to your family s thanksgiving table
food banks receive donations from generous people , but oftentimes they get an outdated can in the mix . in some cases , a recently expired can is still edible , but what about a product that is years beyond the expiration watch the video to see what a can of sweet corn , with a best used by date of august 1982 , looks like when it s opened by an employee of a food bank in cardiff where the item was donated . she runs a can opener along the top , which appears to be free of any dents or rust , and it makes a fresh pop as it s cut into . once open , you might be surprised to find that the corn looks every bit as fresh as a can that has not expired . by all appearances , it s fresh and bright in color , but does it pass the sniff test while the woman smells it and doesn t say it smells like it s gone bad , she does note that it has a very strong metallic odor . based on the long overdue date and the tin smell , she says it s not okay for consumption . needless to say , the vegetable doesn t undergo a taste test , but if her reaction to the smell is any indication , it s not going to taste very good . others noted that another item in the lineup of donated products was a heinz kidney soup , which is a flavor that s no longer made . the can is believed to be at least 46 - years - old helen bull , the trust s partnership and fundraising manager , explained the reason why they sometimes get older donations , noting : especially at harvest time people empty their cupboards of food they no longer need . it s out of a generous heart but i just think they don t think and don t necessarily look at the dates . of the heinz can , she noted , it would be great if anybody wants to give us lots of money for it . it should probably be in a museum . the outdated can of soup even caught heinz s attention , as the company tweeted : wow that soup was discontinued over 35 years ago . should be in a museum rather than a food bank as for what they do when they receive out - of - date food items , helen explained : sometimes we do end up throwing quite a lot of food out . we get an awful lot of out - of - date food . these vintage cans , however , she said they will keep , saying , it might remind people to give us in - date food . one commenter on the mirror s coverage of the story noted that they would likely have given the food a taste , saying : i would of tasted it . i reckon it would be fine we in the uk eat with our eyes not our mouths / taste buds . well not me . stilton anyone another noted : i don t look at dates . they said they found some corned beef from the napoleonic wars which was still edible . that s good enough for me . if it smells and looks oK one commenter further noted that they re not that fussy , explaining , my mum gave us ketchup which was suspiciously dark ( although we still ate it ) it was 15 years old . we also found a tin of condensed milk that was 20 something years old and tried it looked dodgy , tasted fine mind you i love condensed milk so maybe i m just not that fussy .
i don t know about you , but i love getting fresh strawberries . when we have some time on a weekend morning , my wife and i make pancakes and put some sliced strawberries on top before dousing it with maple syrup . it s a delicious breakfast item but hardly the only way to enjoy fresh strawberries . these versatile berries are good for many things from breakfast to dessert and even as an add - in to some salads . and if you re like me , you like to stock your fridge with fresh fruits and vegetables . and why should you but strawberries can spoil and then you waste your money . however , expert farmers revealed a revolutionary tip to help you make your strawberries last longer . strawberries are a delicious way to add some nutrition into your diet . they re loaded with vitamin c , folate , potassium , fiber , manganese , magnesium and tons of cancer - fighting antioxidants . they re a great way to get a much - needed nutritional boost . strawberries have been linked to improving brain function , boosting eyesight , reducing high blood pressure , decreasing symptoms of arthritis , and even lowering the risk of some cardiovascular diseases . if you re not eating strawberries on a regular basis , you re missing up on a great boost to your diet . you should definitely buy some this week . and after learning this tip , you ll be able to ensure they last longer than usual . while strawberries might be on sale some seasons of the year , they re usually pretty expensive . so it s a shame when you forget about them and then they spoil . it can sometimes deter you from buying them again . but don t fear there is a way to help them last longer . hip2save shared a life hack to help keep your strawberries fresher in the fridge for longer . to make your red berries last longer , you just need some white vinegar . simply mix one part white vinegar with 5 parts water in a large bowl . think about using cup vinegar with 2 cups of water . mix the liquids together then soak your berries in the vinegar mix for a few minutes . after that , the strawberries shouldn t spoil for a while . the vinegar helps get rid of mold spores and other bacteria that start to rot away the fruit before you re ready to eat them . while you might be a little squeamish around using vinegar , don t worry it doesn t make your strawberries taste any different . instead it just cleans them better than water alone . once you ve soaked them in the white vinegar solution for a while , drain them out in a colander or a salad spinner . and when they re all clean , pop them into a container and store them in your fridge like you normally would . but if you really want to make them last , dry them thoroughly then place them onto a paper towel inside your fridge . another tip : if you notice a moldy strawberry in the bunch , remove it immediately . this can help prevent the mold spores from traveling to other berries and running more of them . please shaRE this UsEFUL KitchEN tip with a friend online today

japan has repeatedly been condemned by the united nations and european leaders for refusing to take in more than a handful of muslim asylum seekers in any given year ( only 11 were granted asylum in 2016 ) , but they not only are standing firm on their policies for refugees and immigration , they are making it even harder for asylum seekers to work . mindful of the fact that so - called multiculturalism ( when it consists of large numbers of muslims ) has been a failure in europe , where most muslims refuse to assimilate and the majority of refugees , who have little or no skills , will live on welfare benefits for most of their lives , japan sees no need to cave in to international pressure to be more welcoming to refugees . on the other hand , japan is one of the world s leading financial contributors to refugee assistance programs , as long as those refugees are not in japan . business insider ( h / t marvin w ) japan will limit asylum seekers right to work starting today , making changes to its refugee system that are likely to swell the numbers of those in detention centers , the justice ministry said , prompting refugee groups to flag humanitarian concerns . the move to tighten one of the developed world s toughest refugee systems , which accepted just ten during the period from january to september last year , is a bid to clamp down on what japan views as a system of back - door immigration . from monday , the right to work is to be limited only to those japan regards as bonafide refugees , while repeat applicants and those failing initial checks will be held in detention centers after their permission to stay in japan expires , the justice ministry said . we want to focus on responding appropriately to refugees that need protection , justice minister yoko kamikawa told a news conference on friday , adding that the changes do not mean the government will be reluctant to accept refugees . asylum seekers with valid visas now receive renewable permits to work in japan while their refugee claims are reviewed a system the government says has spurred people to seek asylum as a means of finding jobs . with its shrinking population and high barriers to blue - collar immigration , japan is grappling with the tightest labor demand in decades . this has spawned a gray labor market , in which worker - strapped companies hire asylum seekers to make up the numbers , reuters investigations have found . the number of asylum seekers in japan has risen steadily in recent years to a record , with more than 14 , 000 applicants between january and september last year , an increase of almost 80 percent from the year earlier period , ministry data shows . about 60 percent of those asylum seekers would not qualify for work permits under the new system , said justice ministry official tetsuya hagioka , who oversees the refugee system . the changes , which could lead to more detentions , will affect only those who seek asylum after monday , hagioka said , adding that current holders of work permits can continue working while their claims are reviewed . japan s immigration detention centers held 417 , 383 people in 2016 , the latest year for which data is available . the figure includes those detained more than once during the year , however . activists say cracking down on asylum seekers looking for work will not resolve the issue , however . the abuse of the refugee system stems from the fundamental fact that japan suffers from labor shortages and yet does not accept foreign workers , said eri ishikawa , of the japan association for refugees . we are greatly worried about the government threatening the asylum seekers livelihood without addressing this core issue .
the publicly - funded cbc has published an opinion piece arguing that canadians who have large families should be shamed , and that the country instead should be importing more ( muslim ) and other 3 rd world freeloaders . breitbart ( h / t marvin w ) the crown corporation , which is roughly analogous to britain s bbc , ran the the crown corporation , which is roughly analogous to britain s bbc , ran the article in response to fixer upper stars chip and joanna gaines s announcement that they were expecting a fifth child . kristen pyszczyk , a toronto - based writer whose interests include feminism , mental health , addiction , pop culture , and digital media , claimed that having a child was not just a personal choice , but a choice that affects everyone who inhabits our planet . she argued that the social media backlash the gaineses have received represents a conversation we need to have in order to challenge our uncritical acceptance of the life - fulfillment - through - procreation story . the main thrust of pyszczyk s piece is that westerners should not be having children because they are bad for the environment . population control is a fraught topic , she admits , alluding vaguely to nasty historical events but claims that it is not an exaggeration to say that the survival of our species depends on it . shame is a powerful tool for changing behaviour , she notes , suggesting that girls who are groomed for motherhood from a very early age should be subjected to arguments for alternatives . however , she appears to contradict all of her arguments about climate change and individual carbon footprints at the conclusion of her article , in which the potential impact of falling canadian birthrates is breezily dismissed with an appeal to mass migration . how simply replacing canadian children with migrants would in any way mitigate people s impact on the environment is never explained .
asha awur , a sudanese muslim mother - of - six , says there are too many laws in australia and not enough welfare handouts , which means she will have to start stealing to get enough pocket money to give her kids for entertainment , so they won t join gangs . she says her centrelink payments are not enough to raise her 6 children , which means she occasionally has to deprive them of entertainment , which she believes may have led her son to join a gang for which he was imprisoned . she also says it s hard for her muslim children to fit in at school in this predominantly christian nation .

before the trump administration finally found itself able to claim a significant legislative victory because of the tax reform plan in late 2017 , the president marked his time in office by presiding over the shredding of as much pre - existing regulation as possible , no matter the cost . one of the regulations up for the chopping block was the waters of the united states rule , an obama era move that formally extended the government s authority to curtail pollution to small waterways . the original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations . in the aftermath of the rule s implementation , interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government , and in one of them , the supreme court has just unanimously ruled against the government in other words , against the trump administration . the ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself , but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question . the trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges , while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue . the supreme court has now ruled unanimously in favor of industry interests in this case . national mining association president and cEo hal quinn was thrilled with the outcome , commenting : today s unanimous supreme court decision provides much needed clarity and affirms our longstanding position that the clean water act empowers the federal district courts , not the courts of appeals , to initially review legal challenges to the waters of the u . s . rule this win , coupled with the administration s actions in proposing to repeal the rule and seek input on how to properly define waters of the u . s . , puts us one step closer to addressing this deeply problematic rule and the confusion it has created . the administration s apparent legal incompetence on the matter of the waters of the u . s . rule underscores an important point trump and his allies have proven themselves to be at least as concerned with industry interests as they are with protecting the environment . the fact of them not , apparently , knowing what they re doing in this case correlates with a lack of concern . the most infamous example of this apparent preference on the part of the trump administration is the president s abrupt announcement that he would be pulling the u . s . out of the paris climate accord last year . it is worth noting , however , that it requires more to pull the u . s . out of the accord than a single belligerent announcement from the president . more recently , the trump administration moved to open up offshore drilling around essentially the entire u . s . , from california to florida , a move immediately met with widespread criticism . it remains to be seen how the rule change is implemented , if at all , and there has been talk of florida being made exempt from the administration s plans , although that s not certain . what is certain , however , is the trump administration s plans to prioritize u . s . business interests over other interests that the president is supposed to be looking out for as the leader of the country , indicated in everything from the president s tax policy to his environmental policy . featured image via olivier douliery - pool / getty images
one of my favorite things about the holidays is the delicious foods and drinks . at this time of year , peppermint hot chocolate , tasty bread and other baked goods , and other delectable items are available all over the place . just walk into a dunkin donuts or another fast food restaurant , and you ll be greeted with dozens of options to satisfy your holiday foodie itch . but few companies have a monopoly on christmas as strongly as coca - cola . not only does the brand try to equate their soda with santa claus , but they ve also been leaning into an environmentally conscious polar bear theme . although these corporate polar bears have a much better gig than real polar bears that are constantly losing their habitat to climate change as the polar ice caps melt , coca - cola has pushed their version of these bears onto their customers to great appeal . the coca - cola packaging now has polar bears illustrated on it during the holiday season to help celebrate christmas . but these corporate polar bears are hiding a secret in plain sight . while they first debuted on coca - cola packaging in 2016 , they re back for the holiday season in 2017 . and they ve got a big secret that some fans are starting to notice . take a close look at the images here . if you have a can of coke at home , pick it up and put it under a magnifying glass . can you see what the executives at coca - cola have infused into the image of the polar bears reddit user sunkist268 noticed it and shared the observation online . the polar bears eyes are created out of coca - cola bottle caps . and their snouts sheen is shaped like coca - cola bottles . this is subliminal advertising at its finest . when you see the secret image , you ll be hitting yourself wondering how you never spotted it before . but coca - cola has master the art of subliminal advertising and has infused it into their campaigns for almost two decades . perhaps you remember when american idol first debuted . remember how the judges were sitting in chairs that looked just like coca - cola bottles and they also sipped coca - cola during the show . people remarked on the subliminal imagery on the polar bears . the following were some thoughts : omg , i literally had to zoom in but when i did i experienced the magic of christmas , one replied . polar bears have been a part of coca - cola s ad campaigns since 1993 . these versions are new though . this year , we wanted to keep the same look and personality while creating a more graphic illustration style that would be easy to print around the world , frederic kahn , coca - cola s design director , told todaY food . we also wanted to embed signature coca - cola elements so the coca - cola polar bears could immediately be recognizable as our asset . coca - cola knows how to influence the masses . and kahn admits it was all planned out . when the bears are seen from the side , several have coca - cola dynamic ribbons as mouths , and we have some bears holding and drinking coca - cola from the contour bottle , kahn added . do you friends know this about coke
is there a better summer fruit than watermelon of course not . picking out the perfect watermelon at the store can be challenging though how do you select a perfectly ripe watermelon that s ready for your next picnic or barbeque turns out , it s not nearly as challenging as you would think . of course , everyone has their own technique to test out watermelons when they re picking one at the store . this can include thumping the fruit , pressing on the outside to see if there s a little give , and even sniffing the fruit . if you ve tried all of these techniques and still ended up shrugging and just grabbing a watermelon , hoping for the best when you get it home to cut it up , here s a fail - proof way to pick out a ripe watermelon . look at the fruit s field spot . the field spot is the lighter area of the melon where it rested on the ground when it was growing . it s noticeably lighter because it s been sitting in the field on that side . but how can that predict how ripe the fruit is most agree that choosing a watermelon with a golden creamy - yellow field spot means it s the best fruit . the darker that color , the longer it was ripening on the vine and getting sweet . avoid those that don t have a field spot or that have a white spot , which means it was picked too soon . check out the webbing . while you might try and grab the watermelon that looks the most pristine , without any marks on it , there is actually something to the webbing , or lines , that you ll see on the outside of the fruit . these scars indicate the number of times bees touched the flower while the fruit was growing and , with more pollination , the watermelon is typically sweeter . gender matters . turns out , there are boy watermelons , that are longer and taller , and girl melons , that are shorter and rounder . the girls are sweeter , but the boys are more watery . additionally , heavier watermelons have more water and are juicier . fruit size is a consideration . you may be inclined to pick the biggest watermelon you can heft , or assume that a smaller , more compact melon is sweeter . it s best to choose a watermelon that s neither too large nor too small , because the best ones are just average sized . does it have a tail whether or not the watermelon still has a stem intact can be a good indicator of ripeness . the ones with dried stems usually taste better than those with a green tail , which indicates it was picked too soon . those commenting on the youtube video offered their experience with selecting a ripe watermelon , with one commenter explaining their personal experience : i actually used to work part - time at a farm where we used to pick watermelons when i was in high school . the knocking is not pointless . if you knock the watermelon in the middle and it sounds hollow like an empty wooden box , it is ripe . if it sounds like a solid noise it s unripe . the farmer s family taught us that they had been growing watermelons for 5 generations . another commenter offered a tip that probably many follow :
all religions have rules for their followers to abide by . and while they make total sense to the people in the religion , those looking at it from the outside might not understand . one particular religious rule for muslims that other people don t usually understand is their refusal to eat pork . but according to the first amendment , people are free to practice any religion they choose . but now a muslim family from the new york area who were visiting the decatur , alabama area decided to stop for a bite to eat at a mcdonald s . when they got there , they placed an order for 14 sandwiches . they handed over their money . but when they bit into their sandwiches , they found the mcdonald s employees at that location had hidden bacon in the sandwiches consuming pork product is a sin in islam . now mcdonald s is under fire for their treatment of their muslim customers . the family took photos of their tainted sandwiches and shared them online . before long , the council on american - islamic relations jumped on board and accused mcdonald s of intentionally serving the muslim family bacon as a cruel prank . they started noticing it tasted different to them , said khaula hadeed , head of the alabama chapter of the cair . they eat mcchicken all the time at mcdonald s [ in new york ] . they knew what they ordered they know what s in the sandwich . hadeed sees this as a purposeful attack on the muslim family . it doesn t sound like a mistake , especially on 14 sandwiches , hadeed said . he went on to call the cruel prank an intentional act of religious and ethnic bigotry . because this alabama mcdonald s location violated the family s religion , hadeed is calling for a full - fledge investigation into the employees there . the problem was so sever that one of the adults who accidentally consumed the bacon vomited twice . they re essentially disturbed about it , she said . mcdonald s should investigate this incident , identify and terminate the employees responsible , and take proactive steps to satisfy this american family s concerns , starting with an apology . the bacon was hidden in the sandwich so the muslim family would have no way of seeing it but to accidentally eat it . one of the kids opened one of the sandwiches and it had bacon it like a very small , chunk of bacon in there . they were really surprised and kind of horrified , hadeed told huffpost . they opened all of them and , lo and behold , all of them had a small of chunk of crudely torn bacon piece in them either underneath the patty or on top of it in a way where you wouldn t see it . alabama readers are outraged a mcdonald s location in their state would do this to a family .

president trump s year or so in office has been marked by chaos if it s been marked by anything . most days , trump sets the tone for the day s political conversations with an incendiary tweet , the exact contents of which vary from day to day , but range in how outrageous they are from being incendiary to being outright false . in between these tweets , trump sticks to essentially what defined him as a candidate , making grandiose promises and threats and even holding an occasional campaign rally , having filed to run for re - election in 2020 sooner into his first term than any other modern president . he s added threats like one to annihilate north korea to his campaign - era arsenal of threats like the one to build a wall along the entire border between the u . s . and mexico . there s at least one person on the inside who s been reported to be far from impressed with trump s belligerence , even if ideologically it s not as though he s a moderate retired four - star marine general john kelly . trump tapped kelly , who was at the time serving as secretary of homeland security , to serve as white house chief of staff after the departure of reince priebus from the position . in the months since , the relationship between the two men has evolved into something of apparent mutual tolerance , but even that may be fraying beyond repair according to reporter gabriel sherman . sherman reports that two prominent republicans in frequent contact with the white house told him that trump has discussed choosing kelly s successor in recent days , asking a close friend what he thought about david urban , a veteran washington lobbyist and political operative who helped engineer trump s victory in pennsylvania . the president s daughter and unpaid adviser ivanka trump has been involved in the efforts to find a replacement for kelly , according to sherman . in the words of one of his sources : ivanka is the most worried about it . she s trying to figure who replaces kelly . one important note from one of the sources is that kelly wants to one - up his predecessor in terms of the length of his time on the job , so his departure likely isn t imminent . the fissure between kelly and trump has become obvious yet again in recent days and weeks . last week , axios noted that kelly had reportedly told lawmakers from the congressional hispanic caucus and the congressional asian pacific american caucus that trump had been uninformed when promising to build a wall along the entire border between the u . s . and mexico . early the next day , trump took to twitter to rebut his chief of staff s reported attempt at clarifying his boss remarks , writing : the wall is the wall , it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it . parts will be , of necessity , see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains , wastelands or tough rivers or water . ridiculously , trump added yet another claim that mexico will pay for the wall , although that remains a pipe dream at best . kelly also infuriated his boss with his claim that he had evolved in his views since becoming president , as yet another point indicating that kelly will perhaps have a short future in d . c . were kelly to leave , it would top off a first year in which the trump administration set a record for senior staff turnover . featured image via kevin dietsch / pool via bloomberg

early monday , the senate finally came to an agreement on funding for the government for the next few weeks , allowing it to re - open while they continue to hash out various details of the controversy that ever prompted it to shut down in the first place . democrats want protections for the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children and have in the past been protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals program , while republicans , as led by the president , continue to cast democrats support for such protections as blind support for supposedly dangerous illegal immigration . throughout the whole ordeal of the first and possibly not the last government shutdown of the trump administration , the white house has maintained that the democrats were both fully responsible for the situation and had essentially no legitimacy to their position . the administration issued a ridiculous statement at one point calling democrats obstructionist losers . white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders continued on with this rhetoric at the monday white house press briefing , mocking democrats for sticking to their positions to the point of letting the government shut down instead of blindly going along with republicans . a reporter asked her : in addition to saying that negotiating with [ trump ] is like negotiating with jell - o , today [ senate majority leader chuck schumer ] said that the great dealmaker sat on the sidelines . was it a concerted effort on the president s part to not reach out to him this weekend sanders responded by saying that what the president did clearly worked , seeing as the federal government is set to re - open on tuesday . as she put it : i m not sure what changed for [ schumer ] and what he gained , other than maybe nancy pelosi taking a bunch of republican members out for dinner to celebrate their shutdown . i m not sure what other positive things came out of this weekend for democrats . sanders meant that pelosi took out the democrats out for dinner . besides her mistake something borne out of the mindlessness with which she was mocking democrats she s wrong about democrats not getting anything out of the weekend of turmoil . republican leadership promised to take up the issue of the daca program within three weeks , and at the same time , funding was finally renewed for the children s health insurance program , or chip , which republicans had allowed to languish without funding for some time . even in the face of those concessions from republican leadership , some democratic u . s . senators voted against re - opening the government without establishing continued protections for those provided for under daca now . those senators to do so include kamala harris , bernie sanders , elizabeth warren , and others . the president , for his part , has not yet commented on the senate coming to an agreement to reopen the government , although he did rant about the shutdown early monday on twitter . he varied between the line that it s all the democrats fault and the line that it s all the democrats base s fault . check out video of the monday white house press conference below . featured image via screenshot from the video
as the federal government in washington , d . c . , grappled with the senate stalling in its efforts to fund the government to the point of it shutting down over the weekend , vice president mike pence went overseas , kicking off his time there with a disturbingly politicized address to u . s . troops stationed near the syrian border . following his address to the troops , pence went to israel , where he spoke to the israeli parliament , where he told those assembled that the president would ensure the u . s . embassy in israel moved to jerusalem by the end of next year . pence s comments come after the president made the incendiary , controversial move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel , even though the status of jerusalem is one of the items at the center of the israeli - palestinian conflict . effectively taking jerusalem off the negotiating table serves as yet another obstacle in the way forward for the middle east . after speaking to the knesset , pence spoke to the associated press , defending his boss president trump both from allegations of racism and of an extramarital affair with adult film star stephanie clifford , known as stormy daniels . the allegations of racism against the president arose after , following a recent meeting between the president and lawmakers about immigration policy , trump was reported to have referred to countries including haiti , el salvador , and some african nations as shithole countries . trump eventually offered a relatively halfhearted denial of the allegations , although national leaders and meeting participants backed up press reports about what the president had said . addressing the president s alleged comments while speaking to the ap , pence claimed that it s clear that trump s heart is in the right place because of his vocal commitment to a merit - based immigration system over the presently in place , more family and national origin based immigration system . pence said that he knows the president s heart and knows that what president trump wants to do is reform immigration to make our system one that puts the interests of america first . trump has touted his commitment to the idea of a merit - based immigration system numerous times , including in the aftermath of the meeting wherein he was reported to have made the shithole countries remark . the idea of a merit - based system sounds nice to trump and pence , no doubt , and claiming to not see race gives them an easy out when accused of being a racist , but it s not that simple . who is going to be the judge of what merits an immigrant has what if their merits can only be fully realized once they have access to the opportunities available in the united states considering these questions in light of the president s commitment to such policy proposals as the u . s . / mexico border wall and the muslim ban makes his intentions clear he simply wants people who will conform to his vision of the united states . as mentioned , pence also addressed the allegations of trump having had an affair with adult film star stormy daniels , who is alleged to have been delivered a large sum of hush money by the trump team . speaking of these allegations , pence said : i m just not going to comment on the latest baseless allegations against the president . my focus is on serving the president , advancing the priorities of the administration , advancing american interests and that s where it will stay . featured image via sara d . davis / getty images
the russia investigation is continuing to proceed in this new year whether the trump team likes it or not , but just because the president and his team members can t put a stop to the investigation as a whole doesn t mean they re not going to attempt to undercut it . to that end , last may , the president abruptly fired fbi director james comey , who was leading the federal government s component of the russia investigation at the time . in the aftermath of that firing , special counsel robert mueller was appointed by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein to investigate the russia scandal . since then , mueller has brought charges against four former associates of the president , including most recently , former national security adviser michael flynn . understandably , then , the trump team remains interested in softening the bite of the nation s justice system . trump has put this tendency on display numerous times through attacks on the nation s justice system , including his already mentioned firing of james comey . now , axios is reporting that behind the scenes , trump s attorney general jeff sessions has joined in on the effort by trying to convince the man with whom the white house replaced comey christopher wray to fire top level justice department officials including andrew mccabe and james baker . sessions has been casting his pushes as encouraging wray to make a fresh start . according to one of the sources speaking to axios described as a senior administration source sessions has been pushing the fbi director to make the transition since shortly after wray was confirmed , with the conversations having intensified from there . mccabe has actually already attracted scrutiny from the administration in the past , having been the subject of fake news - laden twitter attacks from the president last summer while serving as acting director of the fbi after comey s firing and before wray s confirmation . as axios notes , it s ironic that trump set his sights on mccabe after it was his administration that appointed him to serve as acting director of the fbi . back in late july , trump wrote on twitter : why didn t a . g . sessions replace acting fbi director andrew mccabe , a comey friend who was in charge of clinton investigation but got big dollars ( 700 , 000 ) for his wife s political run from hillary clinton and her representatives . drain the swamp as mentioned , trump s attacks on mccabe , which stretched over a period of days , were riddled with lies . mccabe didn t actually receive any of the clinton associated cash cash , that mind you , didn t come from the clinton camp , but rather from a clinton ally . in addition , mccabe wasn t actually the one in charge of the clinton email investigation ; if someone was in charge , it was then - fbi director james comey . still , trump has long made his opinions about the clinton email investigation clear . he wishes that clinton would have been charged with a crime , even though the orderly legal system already determined that she was innocent . he was speaking against mccabe out of that place of total disrespect for law and order , which makes his haphazard treatment of the truth unsurprising . following his initial attacks on the official , mccabe was reported to be considering retiring after he became eligible for a pension , and the president hit him over that too . as for jeff sessions , he was actually revealed to have secretly met with the then - russian ambassador to the u . s . during the trump campaign and thus , as a possible subject of the investigation , had to recuse himself from the russia probe . sessions reportedly having pushed wray to fire top staff members doesn t necessarily mean that he s violating the terms of his recusal , but it s still suspicious meddling in the affairs of the fbi , which trump and his allies seem convinced is out to get him . featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images

for ages and ages , people have been burning sacred herbs and using the smoke as a form of purification for their rituals and ceremonies . and while they obviously sensed something about this practice on a spiritual level , science is finally starting to catch up . if you aren t aware of what smudging is , it is a practice in which native american s and other spiritual traditions would bind herbs ( like sage ) together with string and then set them to fire enough to produce smoke . the smoke would then be used to cleanse areas of evil or negative energies and to cleanse people pre - ritual as well . in a recent paper entitled medicinal smokes , information was reviewed from over 5 continents and 50 countries . what scientists discovered was that not only does smudging aid lung , brain and skin function , it also does indeed purify the air around us . a follow - up study was conducted not long after that was published in the journal of ethnopharmacology . according to it , smudging sacred herbs also doubles as a powerful antiseptic . we have observed that 1 hour treatment of medicinal smoke emanated by burning wood and a mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs ( havan s magri = material used in oblation to fire all over india ) , on aerial bacterial population caused over 94 reduction of bacterial counts by 60 min and the ability of the smoke to purify or disinfect the air and to make the environment cleaner was maintained up to 24 hour in the closed room . absence of pathogenic bacteria corynebacterium urealyticum , curtobacterium flaccumfaciens , enterobacter aerogenes ( klebsiella mobilis ) , kocuria rosea , pseudomonas syringae pv . persicae , staphylococcus lentus , and xanthomonas campestris pv . tardicrescens in the open room even after 30 days is indicative of the bactericidal potential of the medicinal smoke treatment . we have demonstrated that using medicinal smoke it is possible to completely eliminate diverse plant and human pathogenic bacteria of the air within confined space . basically , burning sacred or medicinal herbs cleared the air of bacterial populations by as much as 94 . even 24 hours later , the area was still disinfected . scientifically , the air quality in modern times contains up to 1800 bacterial types , many of which are pathogenic . while we still may not have all the evidence backing smudging s spiritual aspects , it has been shown that smudging is quite effective at combating bacteria . with strains of bacteria growing to be anti - bacterial resistant on a moment to moment basis , it s obvious we can use all the help we can get . with that being said , excuse me while i go grab my smudge stick featured image via deep soul
with a number of people now identifying as spiritual rather than religious , researchers have begun investigating to better understand how spirituality plays a role in the modern life . and while we all may understand that spirituality somehow just makes us better , science is beginning to prove it . according to the national alliance on mental illness , 1 in 5 adults in the u . s . - 43 . 8 million or 18 . 5 experiences mental illness in a given year . due to these astoundingly high numbers , experts have begun to seek answers to this crisis in all walks of life . and with spirituality playing such a major role in many people s lives , researchers began to wonder whether or not spirituality could aid in the treatment of mental illness . in order to put this into perspective , it is important to understand what exactly spirituality is . while there is no one definition , there are a number of ways to better understand what spirituality truly means . for starters , spirituality is an individual experience that any person can take part in . it helps to bring meaning and purpose to the lives of those experiencing it . furthermore , spirituality can bring hope and healing to those who are suffering . and it can encourage us to seek out a loving relationship with ourselves . spirituality is also different from religion . while religious traditions include spirituality , spirituality is separate from religion . in fact , in order to be spiritual , religion isn t even necessary . what s more , is that scientists are beginning to understand that spirituality could be paramount in helping the mentally ill to combat their illness . according to the indian journal of psychiatry , there are many links between spirituality and recovery from their illness . in one study , it was discovered that spirituality helped children from smoking , drinking and drug abuse , by combatting the impact of life stresses . in another study , researchers monitored three groups of people , one with psychotic illness , another group of formal caregivers , and the third group of informal caregivers . while those that were ill held their existential needs as most important , the groups of caregivers considered their material needs to be most important . with that being said , another study found that the majority of parents with a child sick with mental illness felt that spirituality was important in the treatment of their children and wanted spirituality to be included in their treatment . so how exactly does spirituality help those who are suffering while researchers aren t entirely sure , they believe it has to do with the connectedness to something bigger than yourself which can make coping with mental illness much easier . in a way , it helps them to make sense of what they are experiencing . with spirituality holding such an important role for the mentally ill , where can we begin to incorporate it into our treatments while you don t have to run to your nearest spiritual guru to benefit from spirituality , there are a number of ways you may benefit from it . nami suggests seeking times of relaxation or even meditation in which you focus on places , people , and experiences that give you feelings of peace , awe or greater meaning . for some , finding peace in nature can greatly benefit them , and for others , something as simple as listening to a meaningful song can help . if you are already a spiritual person , just incorporate your favorite practices into your treatment plan . personally , i enjoy using crystals and incense to aid in coping with my illness . what are some ideas you may have

walls : a history headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next walls : a history the hopi creation story of this world begins as the last world was ending in some nonspecific calamity . a few people were taken underground , saved by ant people . the ant people took our ancestors underground and taught us how to survive , how to grow food and hide from disaster . eventually people returned aboveground to and were told to walk the four directions and reunite . at first the creation story such seems like many indigenous tales , but comparatively and allegorically speaking the hopi creation story approaches perfection in its eloquence . ants are the only animal in the world that humanity can be accurately compared with so much so that perhaps mankind was influenced by ants more than any other being . humans and ants are farmers , warriors , harvesters , thieves and enslavers alike . no other animal behaves like man , except ants , no other being is as warmongering . individually we each might be more like a dog or cat , or perhaps we might like to see ourselves as similar in character to a bird , but as a collective mankind is like antkind . human history in total , from whatever nationalistic , religious or otherwise jingoistic perspective one endures can be read like a proud argentine ant s recital of the invasion of new orleans , and california . the argentine ant spent millions of generations building up not only defensive structure , but amassing invasion forces to take over as much of south america as antly possible . any other ant colony they encounter , they destroy . they vanquish all other antkind and if ants believe anything at all , they must believe they are the chosen ant . ants are extremely intelligent if intelligence is measured in utilizing surroundings as tools . the argentine ant grew accustomed to hopping on floating leaves or debris in the argentine flood plains and hitching rides downstream to effectively expand their territory . they were such mighty warriors with such rich resources that no other ant could challenge them . when steamships began embarking from argentinian shores they carried with them invasion force after invasion force of the chosen argentine ants . wherever the ship was steered the ants embarked and began total and complete annihilation of all other ants and competitive life . the chosen ants have now formed a global collective . the megacolony of god s chosen ant superpower has conquered california , japan , and most of the mediterranean and they are right now , on the march . interestingly enough , the argentine ants recognize and accept each other no matter what continental colony they are from , and destroy all other ants they encounter . societies with population explosions , that extend into the millions , are prone to large - scale , intense , tactical warfare . it s a nature of battle only possible among communities with plenty of excess labor force . mark moffet ants and humans have virtually no societal limit to their growth . the environment limits their growth , not their instincts or biological needs . few other species on the planet operate in this manner . the colony might be hundreds , or millions or billions . no other species have societies of this proportion , and no other animal behaves the way ants and people might . no other species kills and enslaves each other and no other species practices complete confrontation in war like humans and ants . the argentine ant megacolony has traversed the globe staking claim to significant areas on six continents . it is akin to human colonialism only the insect expansion and elimination is even more one - sided . no other ant it seems can stand up to the argentine ants . on the borders of the new intercontinental megacolonies are ant wars of total annihilation where all fall due to the argentine ant s fierceness . human history of the collective is exactly like the history of a more prideful ant colony , only mammalian with opposable thumbs . people are the aboveground version of ants with internal skeletons instead of external ones , with hands and vocal chords instead of antennae and mandible crushers . and instead of being capable of lifting great weight like ants , people are capable of inventing great machines . within the colony the queen lives for decade and workers live for years . the expendable males live for a matter of weeks . nests might have a history of multiple queens , but the colony at large has a rich history of millions of years and the collective acts with the impetus of such an age old regime . they are biologically reinforced matriarchies with a history that makes the rise of humanity just another pulse of different beings to eat off , with different kinds of leaves to ride . ants farm , they harvest from their surroundings , they enslave and steal from other ants , and they war on each other . perhaps the most amazing similarity between man and ant is the fact that we build infrastructure for future use . mankind and antkind build based largely on concerns for protection from each other , out of concern for war and others stealing from us . ants build anthills and then build massive tunnels based on defense of the queen if enemy ants were to invade . mankind builds in the same manner , as a means of protection . oh great spirit who made all races , look kindly upon the whole human family and take away the arrogance and hatred which separate us from our brothers . cherokee prayer mankind and antkind function , as collectives , the same , only antkind came first . one can almost imagine a curious individual coming up with all sorts of ideas watching antkind build , enslave and behave . perhaps the original pyramids and pyramid builders saw their structures as having antkind qualities , built in symbolic homage to the antkind structure and mindset , or perhaps they were unaware that their great buildings mimicked antkind s mounds . typically instead of underground tunnel defenses man largely built perimeter defenses , though now we have built up walls of every sort . now we have built weapons so destructive we could end all of antkind , mankind and all life on the planet . our weapons remove the ability to protect ourselves with walls or otherwise . because of man s inventiveness walls are now largely technological as is our ability to confront each other . both antkind and mankind build war culture and war structure . it is a celebrated shared tradition . and in many ways what ill - informed people mistake to be art or culture is actually just symptomatic of the war machine s institutionalized control . it is simple to compare ants to humans and actually find reasons for building walls . it is easy to regress and behave like ants , in a collective state . and yet we are individuals , we are humans , not ants . antkind and mankind collective prepare for war instead of for peace . and when the opportunity presents itself , because all preparations have been made , because the opposition is seemingly prepared or is not and therefore ought to be confronted , war takes place . war takes place because it has been readied . at the borders of ant populations wars are taking place right now where millions are being killed every month . the ants kill each other because of their differences , despite the fact they are all ants . humans when placed in bordered blocks suffer the same end , war based on differences despite our sameness . it is arguable that the predominant measure of distinction between people is differences in perception . it is easy to say that we are as beasts and therefore bound to behave as ants and yet we are much more . the most diverse human borders have always been places of the most hair - raising and antennae flickering wars , like the areas in france and elsewhere major fighting in wwi and wwii took place . a more intense example of the ant like nature of humanized borders is demonstrated throughout the middle east . multiple doctrines , including the one true religion , coincide with national differences , heritage distinctions and cultural fluctuations to form borders of all sorts . and war of all sorts . it is easy to say war is inevitable for antkind and mankind both . it is easy to be unconscious and gnash with the collective , but humanity is capable of much more . in fact , our weapons of war demand that we be much more . humans differentiate each other for a variety of entirely absurd or historically valid reasons , but the result is the same - states with proud histories or colonies with biological impulses and the outsiders they clash with along the borders . humans are not so complicated for a human to understand , and we are all spurred by the same godly forces that created ants . so perhaps it is not so difficult to understand which ant is best . it is whichever ant is able to develop and evolve , which so far , for the last 150 million years at least , they have not done much by the way of . it is perhaps an impulse from beyond the beyond to not only be tribal and build walls , but to war on each other . it must be an impulse for ants do not have minds as man does . no matter if one is a tiny robotic entity of an underground ant mound or an aware human , the pulse within to kill beings like you , but not like you enough , is biological impulse . man is more complex than the old ant because of our complex inventions certainly , most made toward and during war . however man is complex mainly due to our consciousness . instead of antennae we have phones . instead of claws and teeth we have knives , guns , and nuclear bombs . we war on each other the same , we enslave each other the same , humans may have very well thought of agriculture in the first place by watching ants and building pyramids in the middle of our cities by watching ant colonies . perhaps the hopi were more correct than we could ever know . perhaps long ago man was adopted by ants , or at least adopted the ant ways . ants were the world s first farmers . they effectively raise livestock too and harvest from their surroundings and such behavior began about 50 million years ago , or more . today many ants still farm or tend to fungus grown in their lairs for the colony to eat , harvesting plant material for the fungus to consume in turn . some ants raise aphids for the colony cafeteria . one can almost envision a curious primal human ancestor watching ants do what they do and gaining numerous ideas , good , bad and ugly ideas . ants are the only other living thing to enslave others , the bigger ants takeover the smaller ants naturally . or like the argentine ants instead of enslaving they annihilate . humanity s enslavement of weaker people is comparable to bigger ants meeting smaller ants . violence and war however perverse is rooted in biological aspects proven by antkind and yet mankind discusses war as tradition , or societal formation , or economics , or politics . people present reasoning for killing each other en masse , but it s a biological response we are able to surpass . or rather we can surpass when we think as individuals , not institutionalized society collectives . if war politics were noted to be base thinking of lower life like that of anthood , people would simply attempt to surpass the biological response with alternative higher thinking . and unlike antkind , mankind can open our hearts and minds to elevate our thinking and being . ants are the only animal that can accurately be compared to man , mainly because no other animals are as culturally developed with such refined caste systems and no other species kill each other on a massive organized scale . no other species wars . mankind is more efficient at construction and destruction , we live a little longer , our colonies are more noticeable and impactful , we voyage to harvest and conquer and practices the same behavior as antkind comparable to them in our simplicity . the comparable harvesting , farming , raising of livestock , enslavement of other ants and war organization of antkind and mankind make us remarkably similar . perhaps of all our shared traits the most detrimental similarity is the fact that antkind and mankind both build walls . perhaps the fact that we build walls is actually the most markedly similar characteristic between us , initiating all other similarities . perhaps the fact that we build walls and forts and prepare for war leads to the tendency to war and plunder those outside the walls in the first place . perhaps the wall builders alone spurred the necessity to find tools as more efficient means of warring or plundering resources or building better forts . ants and humans build complex dwellings in part as a way to defend the collective , which appears righteous , but it is primarily the result of the induced and near permanent collective state of war . it may be that physical and societal walls cause the war state rather than wars necessitating a walled state . humans have been practicing cultural traditions reminiscent of quality ant relationships for thousands of years . the reason humans are so good at building is because we are always at war . humanity has been building walls literally and figuratively since the time of han , nehemiah and long before . the western wall or wailing wall is an ancient wall of high symbolic significance and attachment people have been killing each other at the base of this wall and all walls for thousands of years . the wailing wall is sacred . the great wall of china is another physical line in the sand where people killed each other . the great wall is so great that it can be seen from space and everybody wants you to know that so that you think that walls are great , after all they can be seen from space . teachers teach that walls are great . walls are perimeters , borders , where war is readied and armament is installed and where the bordermind kicks in like that of all great ants . it is significant to note that china did not build the wall initially to keep people out as much as to keep people inside . the most valuable resource of a nation is people , and when there is no wall people tend to leave , which was occurring too much to enable proper taxation / control . walls also make people want to get through them in case there is something worthy behind the wall . walls create confrontation . it is easy to observe ants . we can observe their comings and goings and learn what they do over many lifetimes . imagine observation of people as we would an ant hill or ant farm . imagine we could watch the wailing wall or the great wall of china for a century or two . imagine if we could watch what happened at the berlin wall during its comparatively brief existence . we would see the bordermind of antkind in mankind too . we could see the erection of the walls cause confrontation . walls are an example of false pride . false pride results in the bordermind . an example of false pride is being proud of how you were born ; what country you re from , the quantity of melanin you were born with or without , and the things your ancestors did . real pride , which even that should be let go or minimalized , is being proud of having done something on your own . this false pride in walls built thousands of years ago is the same . forget about the ancient walls and do something new with your own hands . walls have been getting in the way of the development of our collective mentality for millennia . walls make us more like ants than farming or harvesting or raising livestock ever could . walls build up the infrastructure that maintains war and the border mind state of war . mankind builds physical walls for war to promote the bordermind in false pride . we also have the capability to build societal and spiritual walls and encase individuals and whole regions in binds . the mental and spiritual binds and encasements we are surrounded by entrap us just as walls do . and just like walls we believe the walls are protecting us when in fact they are perpetuating the mind state of war , our lacking consciousness . we are educated primarily within walls and informed of the greatness of the great wall . we are informed directly and indirectly as we grow up in the education system of the value of walls . we learn from early on about all the great walls and great wars and great buildings people have erected . and while we re learning the history of mankind we learn to stay in line and shut up . we learn to zip it shut . we learn to seal ourselves up and barricade our mind and spirit closed . we learn to conform by what we are taught and more importantly how we are taught . institutions institutionalized instructions inform us of the value of walls . and in fact institutions are only walls so of course the institutionalized would promote such . we learn that how much we know matters little compared to how much we know about conforming to the status quo . we close ourselves in and make our own individual walls in order to protect us from others , leaving us stuck with ourselves . the bordermind is initiated and we live encased in spiritual and mental walls we built around ourselves through institutionalization . we are walled in by experiences by layers of ego armor and a culture of separation in post - modern society . we close ourselves in from reality in ways we shouldn t and try to in ways we couldn t . no matter who is telling the story , whether einstein or an american indian elder , the valuable truths are eternally applicable . questioning , seeking truth , is also eternally valuable . and so is ceasing cooperation with systems / institutions which on questioning , prove to be wrongful and based on lies . stopping wrong is an eternally applicable and valuable act . stopping to think leads to art and cultural development . proactive focused inactivity spurs societal change and consciousness development of the individual , and the collective . open your heart and mind . do not remain walled in by your armor as institutionally mandated in said and unsaid configurations of the status quo . think . be an individual , not comparable to ants running about as compelled by hollow institutions . have a revolution inside , a revolution of consciousness and overcome the compelling nature of walled institutions . from currenlty free ebook the little green book of revolution by ethan indigo smith : the little green book of revolution is an inspirational book based on ideas of peaceful

new england patriots vs . philadelphia eagles of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next they claim to be patriots . they say that they are constitutionalists . and they say that they are opposed to the thoroughly evil and corrupt globalists and the deep state operatives of the united states political system , the intelligence community , the military - industrial complex , the pedophile and human trafficking networks , and their witting and unwitting accomplices in the mainstream and the alternative media . while , however , completely ignoring the globalists and deep state operatives of the jewish , christian and muslim religious establishments in the united states that provide the theological foundations and justification for this evil and corruption .

before the trump administration finally found itself able to claim a significant legislative victory because of the tax reform plan in late 2017 , the president marked his time in office by presiding over the shredding of as much pre - existing regulation as possible , no matter the cost . one of the regulations up for the chopping block was the waters of the united states rule , an obama era move that formally extended the government s authority to curtail pollution to small waterways . the original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations . in the aftermath of the rule s implementation , interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government , and in one of them , the supreme court has just unanimously ruled against the government in other words , against the trump administration . the ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself , but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question . the trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges , while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue . the supreme court has now ruled unanimously in favor of industry interests in this case . national mining association president and cEo hal quinn was thrilled with the outcome , commenting monday : today s unanimous supreme court decision provides much needed clarity and affirms our longstanding position that the clean water act empowers the federal district courts , not the courts of appeals , to initially review legal challenges to the waters of the u . s . rule this win , coupled with the administration s actions in proposing to repeal the rule and seek input on how to properly define waters of the u . s . , puts us one step closer to addressing this deeply problematic rule and the confusion it has created . the administration s apparent legal incompetence on the matter of the waters of the u . s . rule underscores an important point trump and his allies have proven themselves to be at least as concerned with industry interests as they are with protecting the environment . the fact of them not , apparently , knowing what they re doing in this case correlates with a lack of concern . the most infamous example of this apparent preference on the part of the trump administration is the president s abrupt announcement that he would be pulling the u . s . out of the paris climate accord last year . it is worth noting , however , that it requires more to pull the u . s . out of the accord than a single belligerent announcement from the president . more recently , the trump administration moved to open up offshore drilling around essentially the entire u . s . , from california to florida , a move immediately met with widespread criticism . it remains to be seen how the rule change is implemented , if at all , and there has been talk of florida being made exempt from the administration s plans , although that s not certain . what is certain , however , is the trump administration s plans to prioritize u . s . business interests over other interests that the president is supposed to be looking out for as the leader of the country , indicated in everything from the president s tax policy to his environmental policy . featured image via olivier douliery - pool / getty images
with democrats having to force republicans hand to get them to go along with essentially anything that s not perfectly in line with their agenda these days , there s no real reason to think that congress will do anything about this issue anytime soon . tuesday morning , there was yet another school shooting , this time at the marshall county high school in kentucky . as of nearly 10 am local time , information remains sparse , but the state s governor matt bevin has commented on the situation on twitter . he wrote : tragic shooting at marshall county hs shooter is in custody , one confirmed fatality , multiple others wounded much yet unknown please do not speculate or spread hearsay let s let the first responders do their job and be grateful that they are there to do it for us local news outlet marshall county daily wrote on facebook shortly after 9 am local time that [ t ] here has been a shooting at marshall county high school and the school is on lock down , adding , we will bring you more information as soon as it becomes available . local news outlet wpsd local 6 reported that they had reached out to the marshall county sheriff s department and kentucky state police for information and were waiting to hear back from them as of about 10 am local time . the outlet added that their reporters had confirmed three victims taken to hospitals . this incident comes just one day after a school shooting at a high school outside of dallas , texas , left one injured . as of about 10 am on tuesday , the gun violence archive had updated its tallies to include 873 deaths from gun violence in the u . s . so far this year . updatE : since initial reporting , the number of confirmed fatalities has risen to two , and the number of wounded now stands at 19 , 14 of whom suffered gunshot wounds .
meditation comprehension headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by ethan indigo smith contributing writer for wake up world learn how to see . realize that everything connects to everything else . leonardo da vinci meditation itself is a trick . it is thought to be a complicated practice , but that is confusion . the trick begins in the following contrast : meditation is a simple practice , and yet it enables us to understand , and to perform , complexity . meditation is a practice that benefits the practitioner in innumerable ways , enabling mind and body . and like a lot of magic tricks , this trick really is simply a shift of perspective and a changed perspective can shift everything else , most immediately our thinking and feeling . if we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during the intense part of the game , we can win . if we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during stressful times , we keep our cool . meditation is a trick of perspective . but more than that , meditation enhances our perspective , our consciousness . the word consciousness is used to illustrate our deep thinking and feeling . i like to say that consciousness is the awareness of our awareness . understanding and further practicing meditation enhances our consciousness looking inward ; understanding geometry enhances our consciousness looking outward . ( see : the mandala : the sacred geometry of meditation . ) enhanced consciousness enhances our physical wellbeing and capability . if our consciousness is unwell and our body well , we might easily become upset or depressed , ultimately becoming destructive to our health both internally and externally . but if our consciousness is well and our body is unwell , we might still be joyful and productive , and we are more likely to become well . ( consciousness rules ) enhancing our consciousness also increases our ability to gain control over self , and our ability to accomplish in a productive and enhanced manner . for this reason , meditation is a simple way to trick ourselves to be our most happy and authentic selves . meditation for the youth if every eight year old in the world is taught meditation , we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation . dalai lama if there is one thing that can help individuals be joyful and productive it is meditation . it can help individuals to help themselves , and yet , few people are promoting it generally , and even less so among young people . my inspiration for writing my latest book , meditation and geometry for the youth , was because i realized how lacking meditation instruction is , at home , in schools , in life and even in many yoga classes . my other inspiration stems from a conversation i had with a meditation teacher . long story short , i was facing an immense problem and was upset over it , and moreover i thought it was the biggest problem in the world . what the problem was is not important . the fact that i felt it was a hugely significant problem is what s important . the conversation went like this : i have been thinking a lot about the world and all the people , i said . i have been thinking about the problems in my life , and the lives all the people in the whole world , and i think i understand what the biggest problem in the world is . and i think if we could address just this one issue , all the world s problems would all be solved . i thought at the time that if this one problem could just be solved , everything else would be ok . have you ever felt that way have you ever felt that if you had just one thing , or if things were different in just one way , than all else would perfectly fall into place i continued to tell the teacher what the problem was , and the teacher was stunned but also grinned . as huge a global issue as it was , the problem might as well have been a small personal one . after thinking for a moment he responded , this problem you describe is a very serious one . and all the other problems of the world are serious too , those which are connected and those which are disconnected to this problem you describe . but what is an even bigger problem is the mess from where that problem comes from . the greatest problem in the world , no matter what anyone says , the problem from which all the other problems originate from , is the problem of our lacking consciousness and our unwell consciousness . i was struck . i felt silly . he of course was right . all the problems of the world , and all the problems of your world , all stem from our unwell consciousness . every external problem begins as an internal problem , or something out of balance . that s where meditation can help and to change our world , we need to start with our youth . a strong and steady consciousness solves problems and , just as importantly , does not create them in the first place . a healthy consciousness does not react in a way that creates problems but responds thoughtfully , mindfully creating the future . this conversation made me realize the importance of helping others learn meditation , particularly our youth , so they in turn can help themselves , so they can develop consciousness , and so that problems great and small might meet creative solutions , not just today but in the future . what if we learned to be at peace with ourselves from an early age just imagine how much future generations of children would gain from this regular practice if every child was able to connect to the ocean of consciousness that permeates all that is will stanton meditation and geometry for the youth meditation assists our understanding of intangible , geometry assists our understanding of the physical ; both require and enhance the imagination . ethan indigo smith s book meditation and geometry for the youth is a short and sweet book to introduce young people to meditation and sacred geometry , in a simple format for the youth and youthful alike . it engages and teaches the fundamentals of meditation , offering lessons for all ages on core geometrical concepts and their relationship to meditation and the meditative mind state . helpful toward understanding the world . in the geometry of energy , author ethan indigo smith explores meditation and meditative energies through the sacred four dimensions of geometry . simple and profound , it is an empowering four - step meditation designed to lead to individuation , self - development , an enhanced understanding of energy , and psychological and spiritual cleansing . useful to meditation newcomers and longtime practitioners alike , the geometry of energy provides insights into a variety of meditative processes for psychological and spiritual cleansing and enhancement . about ethan indigo smith : activist , author and tai chi teacher ethan indigo smith was born on a farm in maine and lived in manhattan for a number of years before migrating west to mendocino , california . ethan s work is both deeply connected and extremely insightful , blending philosophy , politics , activism , spirituality , meditation and a unique sense of humor . you can connect with ethan on facebook , check out his author page on amazon , or visit his new websites , geometry of energy and meditation 108 , where ethan offers lessons on individuation , meditation , the conceptualization of energy , and the metaphysical significance of 108 .

in an effort to crack down on the influx of mainly muslim economic migrants from the middle east and north africa while making them easier to deport , switzerland has officially banned citizenship for migrants who have accepted any form of welfare in the last 3 years . for those who cannot or choose not to provide valid documentation about their country of origin ( a majority ) , they would have to pay back all the welfare benefits they received before even being considered for permanent status . breitbart migrants who have lived on state handouts will have their citizenship applications denied in a monumental move to prevent foreign welfare abusers from living in switzerland and on taxpayer funds indefinitely . the new regulations will make it impossible for asylum seekers and migrants who have lived off state handouts in the last three years to become citizens even if they have lived in switzerland as permanent residents for the required time to make a citizenship application , kronen zeitung reports the previous law allowed migrants to apply for citizenship as long as they were not on state benefits at the time of their application . along with the welfare stipulation , the new act requires migrants to demonstrate a greater level of integration than before including making them prove they have a certain number of swiss friends and acquaintances . language requirements vary by canton with most expecting an intermediate level of language proficiency judged on the common european framework of reference for languages ( cefr ) at the b1 or b2 level . while switzerland is not a member of the european union , asylum seekers have attempted to flood into the country through the southern italian border . while many have used switzerland as a transit country to reach germany , others have remained in the alpine state . various cantons and cities in switzerland have attempted to push back against the tide of migrants by making it less appealing for them to come to the country . late last year , the city of zurich voted to dramatically cut benefits to failed asylum seekers who were in so - called f - status in which they cannot be deported . an estimated 5 , 300 failed asylum seekers live in the z rich canton with f status meaning that whilst they have failed in their asylum claim , the government cannot deport them back to their home country because of potential dangers to them . formerly , migrants with f status received around 900 swiss francs ( 691 ) per month but now will receive only the emergency fund amount of 360 swiss francs ( 276 ) each month . the legislation has gone into effect as of january 1 and will urge migrants to obtain full - time employment as well as reimburse the nation for any welfare received during their stay . those who meet this requirement will have the right to apply for swiss citizenship , a privilege that countless migrants have sought in order to exempt them from extradition in the event that they are convicted of a deportable offense . the law will also make permanent residence documents granted to asylum seekers and migrants invalid as long as they have lived on welfare benefits in the last 3 years . the previous legislation provided a loophole for welfare abusers who were not receiving state handouts only during the time of their application . many of the migrants entering switzerland have also come without any form of identification , making it even more difficult to process their asylum claim or deport those not approved for asylum status . simonetta sommaruga revealed late last year that the government is unaware of the true identity of nine out of 10 asylum seekers in the country , mainly because they discard any documents they had , and try to claim to be refugees from syria , which they believe will give them priority status . swiss national councillor more about islam and switzerlanD
would you like some dip with those maggots is essentially the only way to bring some humour into a situation when maggots appear on a meal you are serving . this precise incident did occur for staff at a sydney pub , who had to admit they served a steak riddled with larvae to unsuspecting customers . the unfortunate recipient was stella kim , who still gets ill when recounting the night of her anniversary . a special night turned sour to say the least . for the ranch hotel , located on sydney s north shore , the pr disaster relief is not going to be enough to save the face of the establishment . the pub insists they are adamant about food safety , but also admit to letting these larvae sneak onto the meat before being served up . kim had picked the hotel as the romantic location to celebrate 1 , 000 days with her partner sushil lamichhane . both ordered steaks , but when they arrived it did not take long to notice the little critters . i couldn t believe if this was real . it was horrible , unbelievable , said kim to news . com . au . maggots were crawling over and there was a lot of them . it was like a rotten carcass . the facebook video gives a good enough idea of what it looked like for the couple , who lost their appetite for a few days afterward . the ranch hotel is one of the most pre - eminent establishments in australia . it is owned by australian leisure and hospitality ( alh ) group , which is a collaboration between the mathieson family and woolworths , a major retailer . the pub issued a statement from management on their website shedding more light on the situation . apparently of the 262 steaks , they sold that day , only one was returned for cleanliness reasons . our investigation concluded that the incident was due to blowfly larva laid after the meal was cooked , as it is not possible for larvae to survive the cooking process , read the statement . all our kitchen staff are experienced and accredited in food safety and the ranch stands by its food safety record and processes . the pub also reached out to apologize to kim as well as report their own mishap to local government . the rationale given by the pub has not convinced ms . kim . the ranch has been saying this happened instantaneously and worms burst out somewhat like the big bang that created our universe , says kim . if someone is ( an ) expert in biology and thermodynamics , please review the video so that they are educated on food handling . this echoes the attitude many customers of the pub have towards the rationale given by the pub and like kim , some of them may avoid the ranch all - together in future because of it . however , another example of maggots in steak indicates the ranch was correct in their assessment . in july , a family in melbourne found maggots in a steak they bought in the supermarket that emerged only after cooking . the meat had a couple of weeks before it was past its use date , and was just kept in the fridge before barbequing to keep it fresh . according to the skye blackburn , an expert in entomology in the employ of food chain aldi , has taken a closer look at the meat supplied to the family . it is most likely that the eggs had been laid after this meat had been cooked , and the heat of the meat has accelerated the hatching of the eggs , says blackburn . blackburn went on to explain in more detail . heat allows eggs the potential to hatch within minutes of being laid . due to higher than average temperatures we re experiencing at the moment , it is common for the life cycle of insects to occur more quickly .
when a police force in a rural part of the united states shared a picture of their cooked breakfast , which included eggs and sausage , you wouldn t think anyone would be offended . but vegans who saw the image were furious . they began lashing out at the cops for posting the photo of the hearty breakfast . but the north wales police rural crime team had simply posted the photo to support the local farmers in response to the national farmers union ( nfu ) posted a farmhouse breakfast campaign meeting . the cops spared no expense when cooking their breakfast to support the farmers . it includes plump breakfast sausages , dozens of perfectly poached eggs , ham , baked beans and enough slices of toast for each officer . the image was posted to twitter , and most people were happy to see the rural police force supporting the farmers in the area . but one woman named diana , who claims to be a vegan , lashed out and wrote : speaking as a taxpayer , i d prefer them to be less selective when answering questions and perhaps not post breakfast pics that offend vegetarian / vegan followers pretty thoughtless considering the job title they have . although diana thought she had a good argument , many other members of the community were quick to retaliate . farmer jono dixon shared the following in response to diana s post : it s pathetic . the vegans are ruling the roost . they are nothing more than a menace . we as carnivores or vegetarians don t dictate about there preferred diet so its time they stopped trolling and whining about everyone s daily diets . although people were eager to hear what rural crime team leader rob taylor had to say in response to diana s vegan outburst , he said his lack of response had nothing to do with the vegans who found the breakfast feast offensive . we regularly get 1 m impressions each month , and in august alone we had 1 . 9 m impressions , crime team leader taylor said . we just can t answer ( all inquiries ) anymore as it s a huge commitment . over christmas , we had too much general interaction with people from various walks of life bombarding our feed with questions , and we couldn t cope . because the rural cops care about the farmers in their area , they plan to continue to post to their twitter page . they have about 15 , 000 followers and an extensive reach on social media . most of their followers love them and support everything they do . although the rural crime team refused to admit that the vegans had won , since christmas day , they have not posted any more images showcasing the eggs and bacon they eat to start off their day of crime fighting . they did share the following post : we have considered all options , and from immediate effect , we will cease responding to comments and questions until further notice . readers of metro generally did not find the sausage offensive , but felt that way about the vegan post . previous generation : sticks and stones may break my bones , but words will never hurt me . today s generation : everything hurts . do you think it is okay for the police to share an image of their breakfast if it includes meat
recently , a federal judge ruled against mccormick co . and has decided to proceed in a lawsuit concerning the size of its ground pepper product , and despite the company s request to dismiss the motion . a smaller spice seller watkins , inc . , sued mccormick last year after discovering that the competitor had removed 25 percent of their product although using the same tins . the picture here demonstrates what watkins is aiming to accomplish with this case . obviously , when compared side by side , mccormick seems to have more pepper than the watkins container even though mccormick is fooling its customers with a visual trick . that s right , mccormick is essentially using an optical illusion to sell more ground pepper than watkins . do you think this is fair although the two mccormick ground black pepper tins appear to be the same size which they are the one of the left contains 8 ounces of product while the one of the right only contains 6 ounces . the smaller tin on the left , which houses the watkins ground black pepper , houses 6 ounces of product . even though mccormick and watkins sell the same amount of product in their tins , mccormick uses a larger container to fool the customer into thinking they re getting more pepper . because of this deceit , watkins has sued mccormick . they argue that mccormick is deceiving their customers by reducing the amount of pepper in their non - see - through containers while not changing the size of the tin . although the product says 6 ounces on the bottom instead of 8 ounces , it is written in tiny font that only the most astute shopper would notice . according to the original watkins Pr release , mccormick has been illegally slack filling ( under - filling tins ) its ground black pepper in tins in a manner that misleads retailers and consumers and is an illegal , deceptive marketing practice . watkins has claimed the mccormick s deceitful marketing tactic had hurt sale of spices . when put side by side , the customer invariably assumes that the mccormick brand is selling more ground black pepper but in truth , the containers hold the same amount . on the other hand , mccormick says they have not falsely advertised their product . why because the correct product weight is listed on the tin . but now mccormick isn t just being sued by watkins . they also face a class - action lawsuit from consumers who feel that they ve been tricked and swindled out of their ground pepper . have you bought the new tin of mccormick ground black pepper without knowing this case currently makes its way through the federal courts . as consumers , don t trust any products you buy . inspect them and make sure you re getting what you think you re getting because companies are all too eager to rip you off at any opportunity they can get . integrity in the marketplace is fundamental , said mark jacobs , ceo of watkins , for nearly 150 years watkins has built its reputation with consumers as a premium high quality products company with impeccable honesty and business ethics . as america s first consumer products company to offer a money - back satisfaction guarantee in 1868 , we stand behind the quality and value of our products , and believe the consumer always deserves full transparency to determine value . do you think mccormick is deceiving you as a customer
what seemed like a rudimentary sketch of an old - man turns out to offer much more mystery than meets the eye . this profile sketch went viral on social media sites as people began to realize he is missing an ear and has a rather strange moustache clearly something was up . those responsible for the sketch insist only 1 of people will be able to decipher the animal in the picture within 2 minutes . are you able to spot it do you think it s only part of an animal head rather than the whole thing did you spot it within two minutes doing these kinds of experiments are a fun way to keep your brain active and your eyes a flutter as the day rolls on . the test is just like one of many optical illusions being shared around the internet these days . these optical illusions might be inspired by psychological testing material because it s true that psychologists do a fair amount of visual cue testing . have you ever heard of the rorschach test it s a psychological test in which a patient interprets what they see in different inkblots on paper . these interpretations are recorded and analyzed by the psychologist . but don t worry , this face is not some kind of psychological assessment . it s merely an optical illusion meant to surprise people and expand their minds can a face really look like an animal when looked at in a different way after seeing this face we know that it can . since it s not a test , there is no pressure to try and get it in under two minutes . if you do get it , then you can count yourself in the 1 of people who have incredible skill at analyzing complex images . you would make a great forensic psychologist or computer programmer ( if you are not already one ) . and since it s all for fun , we will give you a hint to help you succeed ( because we really want you to succeed ) pay special attention to the right side of the man s head . it is from this odd - shape that you should approach the image . think of all the features of the face in relation to this starting point , and begin to see what two pieces match together . we also suggest looking up animal images on google to get an idea of the shape , size , and contours of animal heads you think might just be the one . the more you search , the closer you will come to understanding the cartoon - like design of the man s head . don t worry about doing a little research on the side no one said it was out of bounds . take it as the starting point for interpreting the rest of the shapes and if you re lucky , you will be part of the hallowed 1 think you have it down share it with your friends and see what they find . it may be that you all see a different animal , which in itself is quite exciting . perhaps you all have subconscious biases towards certain types of animals you know better than others .

surely , if you live in the capitals of sweden or germany or belgium , you have entertained the idea of leaving . not to mention the southern areas of greece and italy , where hordes of illegal alien muslim invaders posing as refugees are being dumped off by the boatload from ngOs and human traffickers the result of which is turning once tranquil and beautiful resort areas into migrant slums ridden with crime and rape .
in this 7 - minute tirade , our hearts go out to this woman who has become afraid to live in her own city for one reason , and one reason only , which she dares not mention , lest she be called a nazi . she is afraid of being attacked or raped , especially at night . she is afraid for her grown children to out of the house at night . she is at a loss for what to do but is contemplating organizing a march with her fellow german women against what has become out - of - control crime and rampant sexual assaults on young girls and women . against a police force that seems incapable of doing anything about it , or even worse , a police force that is not permitted to do anything about it . . for fear of being accused of anti - muslim racism ( even though islam is not a race ) . notice how she dances around the reason because she can t even bring herself to mention it in this video , or it could lead to her arrest by angela merkel s thought police .

the fbi targets black ideology it is a catch - all for blanket repression of black activism of any kind . the fbi has apparently chosen a new heading under which to lump black americans targeted for political persecution : black identity extremists . there s a simple explanation for the new categorization . the fbi is a bureaucracy whose day - to - day work involves drawing up lists of people and organizations to be surveilled , disrupted and prosecuted . the dramatic increase in black movement activity since the 2014 police killing of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , has presented the fbi with a much larger field of targets , including youthful elements loosely grouped under the black lives matter banner . when bureaucracies compile new lists , they typically file them under new names . in a sense , the change in nomenclature is an acknowledgement by the fbi that , after nearly two generations of black political stagnation and capitulation , there is finally a black movement with the potential to upset the status quo . the leaked fbi counterterrorism division report , scooped by foreign policy magazine , also signifies that black grassroots political activity is under the purview of the national security state s war on terror and , therefore , subject to the awesome array of repressive measures authorized to law enforcement and intelligence agencies since 9 / 11 . the change in nomenclature is an acknowledgement by the fbi that there is finally a black movement with the potential to upset the status quo . cointelpro the fbi s program to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize " those designated as enemies of the state was itself exposed as an illegal police state mechanism in the mid - 1970 s . since 2001 , the government s cointelpro - like programs have been superseded by a far more repressive regime , inaugurated by president george w . bush and strengthened under barack obama . the post - 9 / ll national security state has legalized the world s most intrusive surveillance apparatus and detention without trial or charge , a system designed specifically to crush targeted ideologies meaning , modes of thought and political identification . it is in this context that the fbi s umbrella designation black identity extremists is so insidious and dangerous , in that it targets people based on their ( stated , imagined or inferred ) beliefs and ethnic loyalties , rather than specific criminal acts or even organizational affiliation . it is a catch - all for blanket repression of black activism of any kind . since 2001 , the government s cointelpro - like programs have been superseded by a far more repressive regime . the fbi mindset has clearly been shaped by its frustration with so - called lone wolf islamic jihadists - - individual actors not directly affiliated with al qaida or its offshoots . u . s . police and intelligence operatives speak constantly of the need to identify and neutralize muslims in our midst that have been radicalized or self - radicalized and thus are fair game to be subjected to every tactic of entrapment and dirty tricks . the fbi views black activists in the same light - - as potentially dangerous , self - radicalized threats . the counterterrorism division report cites six armed attacks on u . s . cops in the post - ferguson period , including dallas , baton rouge and new york city , as justification for its ideology - based categorization of the black menace . micah johnson , who shot 11 cops in dallas , appeared to have been influenced by bie ideology based on his journal writings and statements to police , said the bureau . bie ideology is whatever the fbi thinks it is . in the tortured logic of white supremacist law and order , black identification with other blacks is inherently subversive and a prima facie justification for surveillance . the bureau s bie list could eventually accommodate every conceivable political tendency of black thought - - including the ideologies resident in the venerable old naacp , which issued a statement on the leaked fbi document . in a time when white supremacists are marching down city streets with loaded weapons and tiki torches organizing rallies of terror around the country it comes as a great shock that the fbi would decide to target black identity groups protesting police brutality and their right to exist free of harm , as a threat , said naacp president and ceo derrick johnson . the designation targets people based on their ( stated , imagined or inferred ) beliefs and ethnic loyalties , rather than specific criminal acts or even organizational affiliation . johnson then attempts to lay the blame for this state of affairs on president trump , who has emboldened . . . right - wing extremists , white nationalists and white supremacists . but , the fbi has been surveilling black lives matter activists ever since the explosion of resistance in ferguson . as early as december , 2014 , the fbi was discovered to have tracked black lives matter activists at the huge mall of the americas in bloomington , minnesota , in conjunction with state and local officers of the joint terrorism task force . in july of 2015 the intercept reported that feds regularly monitored black lives matter since ferguson , exposing extensive surveillance of the rejuvenated black movement by the department of homeland security and the fbi s joint terrorism task force . the fbi has been spying on black activists since its founding in the early 20 th century . cointelpro was created during the eisenhower administration , and never died . under president obama , black activists became targets of the war on terror , and now the fbi has conjured up a rationale to criminalize african american political thought as black identities ideology . the bureau will ultimately decide what this ideology actually is , and whose head it is lurking in . bar executive editor glen ford can be contacted at [ email protected ] .
ta - nehisi coates is the neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle the disagreement between coates and me is clear : his view of black america is narrow and dangerously misleading . ta - nehisi coates we were eight years in power , a book about barack obama s presidency and the tenacity of white supremacy , has captured the attention of many of us . one crucial question is why now in this moment has his apolitical pessimism gained such wide acceptance coates and i come from a great tradition of the black freedom struggle . he represents the neoliberal wing that sounds militant about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible . this wing reaps the benefits of the neoliberal establishment that rewards silences on issues such as wall street greed or israeli occupation of palestinian lands and people . the disagreement between coates and me is clear : any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of wall street power , us military policies , and the complex dynamics of class , gender , and sexuality in black america is too narrow and dangerously misleading . so it is with ta - nehisi coates worldview . coates rightly highlights the vicious legacy of white supremacy - - past and present . he sees it everywhere and ever reminds us of its plundering effects . unfortunately , he hardly keeps track of our fightback , and never connects this ugly legacy to the predatory capitalist practices , imperial policies ( of war , occupation , detention , assassination ) or the black elite s refusal to confront poverty , patriarchy or transphobia . coats sounds militant about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible . in short , coates fetishizes white supremacy . he makes it almighty , magical and unremovable . what concerns me is his narrative of defiance . for coates , defiance is narrowly aesthetic a personal commitment to writing with no connection to collective action . it generates crocodile tears of neoliberals who have no intention of sharing power or giving up privilege . when he honestly asks : how do you defy a power that insists on claiming you , the answer should be clear : they claim you because you are silent on what is a threat to their order ( especially wall street and war ) . you defy them when you threaten that order . coates tries to justify his defiance by an appeal to black atheism , to a disbelief in dreams and moral appeal . he not only has no expectations of white people at all , but for him , if freedom means anything at all it is this defiance . note that his perception of white people is tribal and his conception of freedom is neoliberal . racial groups are homogeneous and freedom is individualistic in his world . classes don t exist and empires are nonexistent . this presidency , he writes , opened a market for a new wave of black pundits , intellectuals , writers and journalists - - one that coates himself has benefited from . and his own literary dreams of success were facilitated by a black neoliberal president who ruled for eight years - - an example of black respectability , good negro government . his perception of white people is tribal and his conception of freedom is neoliberal . coates reveals his preoccupation with white acceptance when he writes with genuine euphoria : as i watched barack obama s star shoot across the political sky . . . i had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer . and it seemed that they loved him for this , and i thought in those days . . . that they might love me too . there is no doubt that the marketing of coates - - like the marketing of anyone - - warrants suspicion . does the profiteering of fatalism about white supremacy and pessimism of black freedom fit well in an age of trump - - an age of neo - fascism , us style coates wisely invokes the bleak worldview of the late great derrick bell . but bell reveled in black fightback , rejoiced in black resistance and risked his life and career based on his love for black people and justice . needless to say , the greatest truth - teller about white supremacy in the 20 th century - - malcolm x - - was also deeply pessimistic about america . yet his pessimism was neither cheap nor abstract - - it was earned , soaked in blood and tears of love for black people and justice . does the profiteering of fatalism about white supremacy and pessimism of black freedom fit well in an age of trump unfortunately , coates allegiance to obama has produced an impoverished understanding of black history . he reveals this when he writes : ossie davis famously eulogized malcolm x as our living , black manhood and our own black shining prince . only one man today could bear those twin honorifics : barack obama . this gross misunderstanding of who malcolm x was - - the greatest prophetic voice against the american empire - - and who barack obama is - - the first black head of the american empire - - speaks volumes about coates neoliberal view of the world . coates praises obama as a deeply moral human being while remaining silent on the 563 drone strikes , the assassination of us citizens with no trial , the 26 , 171 bombs dropped on five muslim - majority countries in 2016 and the 550 palestinian children killed with us supported planes in 51 days , etc . he calls obama one of the greatest presidents in american history , who for eight years . . . walked on ice and never fell . coates allegiance to obama has produced an impoverished understanding of black history . it is clear that his narrow racial tribalism and myopic political neoliberalism has no place for keeping track of wall street greed , us imperial crimes or black elite indifference to poverty . for example , there is no serious attention to the plight of the most vulnerable in our community , the Lgbt people who are disproportionately affected by violence , poverty , neglect and disrespect . the disagreements between coates and i are substantive and serious . it would be wrong to construe my quest for truth and justice as motivated by pettiness . must every serious critique be reduced to a vicious takedown or an ugly act of hatred can we not acknowledge that there are deep disagreements among us with our very lives and destinies at stake is it even possible to downplay career moves and personal insecurities in order to highlight our clashing and conflicting ways of viewing the cold and cruel world we inhabit i stand with those like robin dg kelley , gerald horne , imani perry and barbara ransby who represent the radical wing of the black freedom struggle . we refuse to disconnect white supremacy from the realities of class , empire , and other forms of domination - - be it ecological , sexual , or others . the same cannot be said for ta - nehisi coates . this article previously appeared in the guardia uk .
cornel west vs . coates : a necessary debate that black agenda report has amplified since its inception coates has benefitted from the neo - liberal brand of black leadership that grew in strength during the era of obama . i began writing for black agenda report over four years ago . as a " non - black " identified person of color , black agenda report ' s commitment to the black radical tradition was an inspiration in a period marked by deep political reaction . black agenda report did not betray its political principles in the face of the first black president at a time when there was immense pressure to do so . black agenda report not only provided a forum for black left political thought and action , but also advanced necessary debates in service of movements for social transformation in the black american community and oppressed communities worldwide . the conversation that has emerged from cornel west s critique of coates is one that bar has amplified since its inception and should not be left in the polluting grips of the black political class and their white liberal allies . cornel west essentially outlined the political program of the black radical tradition by exposing the political emptiness of ta - nehisi coates . coates has made exorbitant profit from book sales and articles for publications such as the atlantic . his recent text , eight years in power capitalized on the rise of donald trump in the aftermath of the obama era . coates has benefitted from the neo - liberal brand of black leadership that grew in strength during the era of obama . his work on reparations , white supremacy , and the obama - trump phenomenon has given him a bright national spotlight . however , with one article , cornel west illuminated how coates has done little more than build a comfortable career in place of genuine service to the masses of poor and oppressed people in the black community and beyond . the conversation that has emerged from cornel west s critique of coates is one that bar has amplified since its inception and should not be left in the polluting grips of the black political class and their white liberal allies . west s intervention is not without a contextual basis . the history of black political thought and action has always been rife with contested debate in the struggle to chart the correct path forward to substantive emancipation . individual black leaders and organizations have debated questions such as the viability of black nationalism , the difference between civil rights and human rights , and the role of socialist ideology in the black freedom movement , to name a few . these debates were products of concrete struggle over the trajectory of the black polity . they provided much needed clarity for the advancement of black liberation . yet when west made clear that coates inability to challenge wall street and war was a rebuke of the black radical tradition , there were many who quickly sought to distance themselves from the substance of west s position . west was channeling w . e . b . du bois , fannie lou hammer , claudia jones , malcolm x , and the black panther party when he challenged coates much - heralded body of work . what black agenda report calls the black political class has never wanted anything to do with these stalwarts of the black radical tradition . this was evident in the guardian when it published responses to west s critique from prominent black academics and black activists . of the four interviewed , only one engaged with the substance of the debate . none openly took sides . west was channeling w . e . b . du bois , fannie lou hammer , claudia jones , malcolm x , and the black panther party when he challenged coates much - heralded body of work . west has received largely negative responses for his critique of coates . his opposition to wall street and war is a fundamental threat to Us imperialism and thus the patronage the system endows the black political class . criticism of west has centered on his so - called lackluster approach . black lives matter network leader patrisse cullors claimed that the debate was " not definitive to our communities . " one can only wonder how silencing cornel west serves anything but the interests of the parasitic imperialist system that has subjected black america to a state of precarity for centuries . perhaps the worst example thus far was published in an article in the intercept . infamous progressive naomi klein and black lives matter leader opal tometi penned a statement that urged readers to forget about the west and coates debate . the focus of our attention should instead be on the need to build a " multiracial " movement against the Us empire . the piece lectures readers about the importance of fighting empire and war yet reduces west ' s arguments to " narrow nationalism . " sloppy organization and a lengthy word count do nothing but prove that the authors of the article had as their primary interest the erasure of the black radical tradition in favor of a color - blind approach to organizing . the klein / tometi piece lectures readers about the importance of fighting empire and war yet reduces west ' s arguments to " narrow nationalism . " there is no time to reduce west ' s criticism of coates to foolish infighting . rather than insulting west ' s critique as " not definitive " to our communities , we should be taking the time to learn from it . internationalism has been a fundamental aspect of the black radical tradition from the very outset of its development . whether coates has or hasn ' t addressed the questions of war and wall street throughout his illustrious career is not of primary concern . the concern is that his body of work is less reflective of the black radical tradition and more so the perils of collaboration with imperialism . west questions coates ' commitment to the black radical tradition by citing both a record of inaction on the questions of wall street and war and a tendency to align with the obama wing of imperialism toward profitable ends . these are questions that black agenda report has placed on the forefront of discussion long before west applied them to coates work . black agenda report has been the only left political journal to consistently expose the black political class and its role in the reproduction of imperialism s exploitative social relations . black agenda report is the lone black left journal that provides both news and analysis on issues of war , racism , and capitalism . the black agenda report team has given ample space for the people to learn from the political debate occurring in movements such as cooperation jackson . editor bruce dixon has been digging through the archives to highlight black agenda report as the only consistent voice when it comes to coverage of the Us - led invasion of libya in 2011 or the black political class support for the demise of net neutrality . black agenda report has been the only left political journal to consistently expose the black political class and its role in the reproduction of imperialism s exploitative social relations . west s engagement with coates is thus nothing new to either black agenda report or the black radical tradition from which it sprung . black america has historically led the way in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism from inside the belly of the beast . imperialism by its very nature has required the destruction of black self - determination , the looting of wealth , and the denial nationhood to maximize the profits of capital . the struggle for black self - determination has thus produced debates within black leadership concerning the correct direction for not only black people , but also for the entire human family . it is the duty of progressive and revolutionary forces in the Us to take sides in such debates , not discourage them . this writer decided to contribute to black agenda report because the debate over the questions of war , wall street , and the black radical tradition must be met with a revolutionary movement dedicated to the development of a new society free of exploitation . black agenda report has shown time and again that it is committed to creating favorable conditions for such a movement to emerge . the black left journal spends each week raising the people s level of political development . working class and oppressed people such as myself find this model attractive . in a moment where mass fear is as palpable as class war , the link between the battle of ideas and the struggle for a new world has become increasingly clear . cornel west has consistently fought in both struggles . the same cannot be said for coates . cornel west has taken the best from the black radical tradition to raise important questions about the role coates s work plays in the future of humanity . ta - nehisi coates was placed at the center of the critique but by no means did west single him out without purpose or strategy . revolutionary ideas are the foundation blocks for the new world we seek . black agenda report has amplified the ideology of the black left reflected in west s critique of coates since the publication s inception . war , racism , and wall street are interconnected phenomena that make up the skeleton of the class war before us . cornel west has taken a side in this war and has challenged us to do the same , whether coates responds to west or not . danny haiphong is an activist and journalist in the new york city area . he can be reached at [ email protected ]
freedom rider : who killed erica garner obama never gave eric garner or his family the justice that he had the power to give . i felt the same pain that my father felt on that day when he was screaming , i can t breathe . - - erica garner erica garner was only 27 - years old when she died on december 30 , 2017 . she was the mother of two children , one of whom was eight years old and the other just four months old . ms . garner became famous when father , eric garner , was murdered by new york city police on july 14 , 2014 . the killing was filmed and the world heard his last words , i can t breathe . most police murder victims die unknown and their deaths are rarely even investigated . garner was killed when thousands of people mobilized in mass protest across the country over the issue of police homicides . because of that pressure the city of new york went through the motions of prosecuting his killer , daniel pantaleo . but the grand jury in the conservative and mostly white borough of staten island refused to indict . pantaleo is still on the force and even received an increase in pay when he earned over time for court appearances . ms . garner was left to deal with her father s death as best she could . she was an ordinary young woman , inexperienced in political activism or media relations . yet she overcame what would be considered short comings by taking the simplest and most basic action . she spoke up . obama s response to demands was phony , meant to give the appearance of action when none was taken . barack obama s justice department only prosecuted two cases of police brutality and eric garner s was not among them . obama s response to demands was phony , meant to give the appearance of action when none was taken . he sent scoundrels like al sharpton to ferguson , missouri but only for show . obama would even meet with activists and family members when he thought he could get political cover by doing so . but he never gave eric garner or his family the justice that he had the power to give . he met ms . garner on one occasion but because of her agitation . in july 2016 alton sterling and philando castille also died in on - camera police murders . in dallas , texas a man named micah xavier johnson exacted revenge by killing five police officers in that city . johnson was himself killed by police using a remote bombing device to do the deed . gavin long did the same in baton rouge , louisiana , killing three police before he too died at the hands of other officers . pantaleo is still on the force and even received an increase in pay when he earned over time for court appearances . the realization that johnson and long changed the political conversation forced the obama administration to hastily stage a dog and pony show entitled the president and the people : a national conversation . ms . garner was invited to attend the nationally televised town hall along with other relatives of police murder victims . but the attempt at window dressing was not completely successful because she refused to be silent . the ulterior motives were so obvious that black lives matter co - founder patrice cullors called the town hall a shit show . it was honestly one of the worst experiences you could ve put families through . it was all about apologizing about the cops , it was just a mess . in short , it was vintage obama . he wanted to dampen black people s justifiable anger and put a happy face on the system s criminality . when her words threatened to ruin the obama effort at damage control she was allowed to speak with him briefly . to her credit , erica garner exposed emperor obama s nakedness . neither she nor any of the other families were permitted to ask questions . she loudly proclaimed that they had been used , railroaded as she put it . she asked an important question , a black person has to yell to be heard of course the answer is yes . it has always been yes . when her words threatened to ruin the obama effort at damage control she was allowed to speak with him briefly . video of the conversation shows him in all of his hollow glory . he was clearly uninterested in ms . garner , mouthing condolences but making excuses for inaction . he barely hid the irritation he felt as he was forced to speak with her . but erica garner s best efforts couldn t move the system and she had challenges in her personal life as well . early in 2017 she was pregnant and assaulted by her child s father . according to her mother she was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and suffered a heart attack shortly after giving birth . a second heart attack on christmas eve killed her . obama wanted to dampen black people s justifiable anger and put a happy face on the system s criminality . the stories of the survivors end this way all too often . they suffer trying to do what it is impossible , act on their own against a system that sanctifies police murder of black people . one could say that pantaleo killer her when he killed her father . then again the obama administration chose not to give her justice and they were accessories too . as a black woman she lived in a society that didn t value her life and that fails to provide basic health care outcomes . there are many perpetrators in this sad story . but she isn t alone . ramsey orta filmed eric garner s death and police retaliated by setting him up in a drug deal . he is serving four years in prison and says he regrets having ever been involved . erica garner is one of many nypd victims . her story is one of bravery but also one of caution . just weeks before her fatal heart attack she spoke of how the system beats you down . all too often the beat down is deadly . margaret kimberley s freedom rider column appears weekly in bar , and is widely reprinted elsewhere . she maintains a frequently updated blog as well at < URL > . ms . kimberley lives in new york city , and can be reached via e -

whether you follow all the optical illusions that are spreading across the internet or not , this one is well worth your time . while many of them are not as challenging as you might imagine , this one is certainly going to get you scratching your head . it is a simple drawing that will make you look twice , three times or four times . it is that confusing . the simple sketch was popular back in the 1980 s and was recently posted to reddit where it went viral overnight . just take a look at the image with one question in mind how many legs does this elephant have does it have four like normal elephants or more like some kind of alien critter check it out below and tell me what you see in the comments below now although the image has been debated at length in the discussion forums of reddit and other websites , people cannot determine the number of legs on this mammal . it is confusing and uncertain . because the picture is sketched in black and white , men and women have numerous answers for it . while common sense tells us that there should be one leg , other people insist that the elephant has more than that namely five legs . but the true answer might make you angry . take a closer look at the picture , because this elephant has only one leg . people have shared their reasons why . but it seems clear if you look at it . many of the legs are only half drawn . they are made to look complete but they re not . the upper part of the limb starts the sketch but it doesn t finish . instead the feet are drawn in the negative space , which makes it very confusing for people . nevertheless , explanations have come in droves . here was one : the reason you ve having trouble with this image is due to the fact that the artist responsible for this image was very clever . the only correct elephant leg in the drawing is the back left leg . that leg is completely intact , but the others aren t . if you look very closely , you ll see that the rest of the legs have the foot missing from them . basically , the artist chopped the feet off of the legs and put the images of the feet between the actual legs . look closely at the image and you ll see exactly what i m talking about . although this is a very convincing answer , many people refuse to believe that an elephant can have fewer than four legs . they don t care if the legs don t have feet . readers on mailonline shared their reaction to the elephant drawing : this picture was doing the rounds when i was at school , about 100 years before the internet was even a twinkle in old tim berners - lee s eye i can see 4 legs but the way the gaps between them have been drawn it is to deceive the viewer that there are 5 . how many legs do you see on this elephant please SharE thiS optical illUSion with a friend online today
first - grade teacher bret turner was just thinking of a way to engage his precocious students over the holidays . he gave his class a tricky riddle to solve over the break , thinking no one would be able to solve it , but giving their brains something to grapple with none - the - less . however , he and most of the twitter world were as surprised as ever to find out that some kids actually do have all the answers to the most complex issues in life . turner should know a thing or two about what young kids are capable of . he is a 37 - year old teacher living in the san fransisco bay area who has spent the past seven years teaching first - and second - graders . he actually has a real love for riddles because of the conceptual work it makes kids do . it is a turner tradition to start each week with a different kind of riddle and let s the kids grapple with it and seek and answer . this one particular week the riddle went like this : i am the beginning of everything , the end of everywhere . i am the beginning of eternity , and the end of time and space . who am i the first one to guess the riddle gave an impressively deep answer : death . while the whole room fell silent over the answer , it was in fact not the right one turner took to twitter to share the surprising turn of events . he mentioned that an awed , somber , reflective hush fell over the class when the word was written out on the board . clearly , it was a lot for young kids to consider the realities of such an immense concept as death . in that moment , turner did not want to reveal the actual correct answer to the riddle , was is the letter e . this was a very typical first - grade moment ; guesses to riddles are always great , and often the wrong answers are better than the correct ones . turner later told the education news outlet tODaY parents . the first answer was not the only one to reference finitude or the nothingness present in the world . some of the other guesses were NOt everything , the end , or even the most surprising : nothingthing . what is even funnier is that when turner actually revealed the answer to the riddle , most of the kids were not impressed . perhaps it had to do with the grammatical nature of the joke , a reference to word - play that is likely lost on 7 and 8 - year - olds . according to turner , the collection of answers pertaining to death was actually indicative of the topics that young kids often speak about . he points out that young kids face death on a regular basis , whether in the form of aging grandparents or a dying pet . they are just as fascinated by it as anyone , and take pleasure in seeking some resolution to it finally happening . while it might no be a surprise to turner , it sure is a surprise to most of us who imagine our kids talking about playing outside and imaginary worlds . the un - groundedness of kids is something we assume without paying attention to all the different things they like to speak about including death .
muslim girls school in the uk has received the lowest ofsted rating available after inspectors discovered that pupils were not provided with toilet paper for islamic cultural reasons . uk telegraph ( h / t trop staff at the park avenue girls high school , in stoke - on - trent , said paper was available from the school office , but because most of the students were muslim , they preferred to wash rather than wipe . the ofsted report stated : at the time of the inspection , it was not the school s common practice to provide soap for pupils hand - washing , toilet roll in the toilets or suitable drinking water . toilet paper is available from the school office when pupils request it . pupils told inspectors that they sometimes avoided using toilets for the whole school day because of this . but headteacher abdul ghafoor salloo defended the policy , insisting the school catered for the cultural needs of the pupils . the children they do use the toilets and traditionally , because we are muslim , we wash , not only wipe . there are facilities for pupils to clean themselves , he said . it might be hard for someone who doesn t traditionally wash to understand and washing is better than wiping clean . the ofsted inspector said there has to be toilet rolls , we said there are always toilet rolls but they are not always out so what itaLY : muslim man washes his anus at a public fountain in the street after taking a dump in the alley : mUsLim toiLEt EtiqUEttE : 1 . when going to the toilet , do not touch the private parts with the right hand .

the state of oregon told a pair of bakers to make the cake or eat a ruinous fine . and sadly , a federal court agreed . now stop me if you ve heard this before : a same - sex couple asks a local bakery to make a wedding cake . the bakers , who are christians , decline to do so on the grounds that it would violate their religious convictions . the couple , feeling deeply aggrieved , files a complaint . the state civil rights agency finds for the same - sex couple and , in effect , forces the bakers to choose between their faith and their livelihood . if you noticed my use of plural nouns so far , you may have guessed that i m not talking about jack phillips , whose case was recently argued before the supreme court . no , this time i m talking about sweet cakes by melissa , and its owners , aaron and melissa klein . not only did the oregon labor commissioner rule against the kleins , he imposed a ruinous fine on them of 135 , 000 . a fine that high is the commissioner telling the kleins , not only are you wrong , you re evil . you need to be put out of business . the kleins appealed the ruling to the oregon court of appeals , and last month the court upheld the oregon labor commissioner . while the outcome wasn t surprising oregon is a very liberal state after all there are some aspects of the opinion that are worth noting . first is what wasn t said by the court . there were no comparisons to nazis or racists , nor were there were references to jim crow . that separates this ruling from that of a federal judge in telescope media group v . lindsey . that case involved two christian videographers , carl and angel larsen , who challenged parts of minnesota s human rights act that would require them to service same - sex weddings . they sought the right to post a notice on their website about their policy concerning same - sex weddings . the federal district court rejected their arguments and then said that what the larsens were proposing to do was conduct akin to a white applicants only sign . now thankfully , the oregon court of appeals didn t make any such crazy comparisons . unlike the federal court in minnesota , it took the kleins claims to freedom of artistic expression seriously . but its reasoning was tortured . it acknowledged that the kleins imbue each wedding cake with their own aesthetic choices , but then added the strange and nebulous line that the kleins have made no showing that other people will necessarily experience any wedding cake that the kleins create predominantly as expression rather than as food . so for the court , what makes something art is that they are both intended to be and are experienced predominantly ( whatever that means ) as expression . say what this reasoning is nonsensical . last may , a college student from scotland left a pineapple on a table at a museum , and visitors treated it as if it were on display . a year earlier , a 17 - year - old left a pair of glasses on the floor of a san francisco art gallery and people stood around and took pictures of it . the guardian called it a work of genius . so pineapples and eyeglasses can be experienced as art , even works of genius , but a cake specifically designed for the context of a wedding might not be look , the court pulled this standard out of thin air . it was a case of , to borrow a line from lewis carroll , sentence first , verdict afterwards . the court realized that making a cake for an event could definitely be speech , but they couldn t allow this speech or those who made it to prevail , so it created a reason why they shouldn t . the fact that it s impossible to imagine this standard being applied in any other context , or to any other direct speech , only underscores this fact . and as i close , please visit breakpoint . org for a special symposium . hear what folks like os guinness , ryan anderson , mindy belz and others have to say about the challenges facing the church in 2018 . again , that s breakpoint . org . editor s note : aaron and melissa klein are represented by first liberty institute . for up to date information about their case , visit first liberty institute s case page here . sweet cakes by melissa , religious freedom , lose on appeal : art in the eye of the beholder challenges like the kleins faced with local and federal legislature and judiciary are likely to increase in the coming year . read what christians thinkers and leaders have to say about the issues facing the church today ; click here to visit our first symposium of the new year , challenges facing the church in 2018 .
two years ago on breakpoint we told you about a promising young christian football player . on monday , he was the hero of alabama s national football championship win . alabama s stunning come - from - behind ncaa championship victory over georgia was fueled by freshman quarterback tua tagovailoa . in a remarkably humble interview after the game , especially given what he d just accomplished on national television , he said : i would like to thank my lord and savior jesus christ . with him all things are possible . now two years ago , on breakpoint , i talked about tagovailoa s faith back when he was still in high school . here s a part of that broadcast from 2015 : sports illustrated recently told the story of tua tagovailoa , who is considered to be the best high school football player in hawaii . the junior quarterback at honolulu s saint louis high school is drawing comparisons to the school s most famous alum , heisman trophy winner marcus mariota . on the surface the comparison is understandable . besides playing for the same high school , both quarterbacks share a similar style that makes them a threat on the ground and in the air . and like so many great players in hawaii , they share a samoan heritage . and it s this last bit that s the most intriguing and inspiring part of the story , at least for christians . at the heart of the sports illustrated story about tua is his relationship with his late grandfather . it s a story about a christian from one generation passing a spiritual legacy to the next generation . the article is filled with bible verses . it tells readers that the entire tagovailoa clan gathers every evening for prayer and teaching , and to sing a samoan hymn that asks god to be present in everything they do . this is something that tua has in common with his hero , marcus mariota . mariota , as we ve said before on breakpoint , is also a christian whose goal is to go out and show the world that christ lives . football fans have long noted the disproportionate number of samoan players in the nfl and in big - time college football . by one estimate , a samoan male is 56 times more likely to play in the nfl than an american non - samoan . football greats like the late junior seau and troy polamalu are only two members of this illustrious line . less known , and even more important , is the role that christianity has played in the lives of so many of these players and in samoan society as a whole . stories like that of tagovailoa , mariota , polamalu , and former raiders quarterback marques tuiasosopo are a testimony to the extraordinary success that 19 th and 20 th century missionaries had in converting the samoan people to christianity . when the first missionaries from the london missionary society arrived in 1830 , they found that there were already some christians on samoa . in keeping with polynesian culture , it arrived via longboat , probably from places like tonga and tahiti , where wesleyan missionaries had already been at work . western missionaries then built on the samoans attraction to christianity . by 1855 the entire bible had been translated into samoan . and before long , native samoan religion had been replaced by christianity . today , virtually every samoan self - identifies as a christian of some sort . more than 60 percent describe themselves as very religious . prominent samoans frequently refer to samoa as a christian nation . the preamble to samoa s constitution describes samoa as an independent state based on christian principles and samoan custom and traditions . what s more , 91 percent of all samoans agree with the statement that samoa is one of the most religious nations on earth . thus , christianity s influence on samoan life and culture is hard to dispute . this legacy and heritage are on display in stories like that of tagovailoa s . the missionaries who brought christianity to the polynesian world wound up transforming an entire society . now , i ve got no idea whether tua tagovailoa is the next marcus mariota on the field . but what matters is that he seems to be following an even more important samoan tradition off of it . and that is worth celebrating . alabama s big win : tagovailoa s big faith for more on the faith and athletic exploits of tua tagovailoa , check out the article links in our resources section .

madeleine l engle said , stories make us more alive , more human , more courageous , more loving . they also can make us more faithful . when the prophet nathan wanted to bring david to repentance , he didn t cite the law on adultery ; he told the king a story . when jesus wanted to show a lawyer what kind of heart god requires of those who would inherit eternal life , he told the man a parable of the good samaritan . when jewish people think about what it means to be a jew , they return to the stories of god s saving acts in egypt and afterwards . do you sense a pattern here an old proverb says , tell me the facts and i ll learn . tell me the truth and i ll believe . but tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever . as we ve said before on breakpoint , the bible isn t primarily a theological textbook , or even a legal code though it has plenty of both of these elements . no , it comes to us as the grand story of god s working in history . through it , we look back and see what god has done , which enables us to look ahead and see what god will do all while placing ourselves as responsible participants in god s glorious plan to redeem all things . the bible s story of creation , fall , redemption , and restoration has fired the imaginations and strengthened the limbs of countless believers in diverse cultural moments , inspiring them to heal the sick , open the eyes of the blind , found universities , discover the universe s secrets , free the enslaved , cross the oceans , and otherwise follow god s call . that s what the christian story does . and , it encourages us to tell the world our stories about the lord working through his people , and not just the famous ones . it s easy to think well , i m no colson . i m no wilberforce . that s why this year , we re committed to telling the stories of those people of whom you ve never heard . and we could use your help . my colleague , warren cole smith , is spearheading this effort . his new series , named restoring all things after the book that he and i wrote together a few years ago , will highlight the stories of followers of jesus making a difference in their communities and around the nation . in a recent article , warren tells the story of colin pinkney , who runs the harvest center in charlotte , north carolina . colin is the seventh of nine children , and his father abandoned his family when he was just nine years old . fatherhood is the silver bullet , if there is one , colin says . it s clear there is a fathering issue in our nation . colin now has six children himself , and his office bookshelf is filled with volumes on fathering . when he was the president of the pta at his children s school , colin led a seminar on effective fathering , and more than 100 people showed up . now , at the harvest center on charlotte s west side , colin leads a full - time staff of 12 and oversees a budget of 850 , 000 . four thousand people a year get help there . many become self - sufficient . how much government money does colin accept zero , he answers , emphatically . he models his ministry on , you guessed it , a story the one found in john 5 in which jesus heals a man lame for 38 years . before he does so , however , jesus asks him , do you want to be made whole i always think of that story as we evaluate our work , colin says . we re asking tough questions . we have to reeducate this community to a better way than what they ve been receiving in the past . you see , what he s doing is teaching people a different story than what they ve known up to this point . you may know a story that would encourage and instruct the rest of us . if so , please let warren and the colson center know . send your stories to warren s email : wsmith colsoncenter . org . we re eager to hear from you and before i leave you today , i d like to invite you to join a movement whose story continues to be written . the pro - life movement has made incredible strides , and we want you to pray for life this month by joining our annual 21 days of prayer for life . we have a beautiful , free downloadable prayer guide , for you , your family , and your small group . just visit breakpoint . org / 21 days . stories that encourage , inspire , restore : send us yours do you have a story that would encourage , inspire and teach then take a moment to relate that story via email to warren cole smith ( wsmith colsoncenter . org ) . we re eager to hear from you and get involved in the story of the pro - life movement : download our 21 days of prayer for life prayer guide and app . click on the links in our resources section for more details .

senators finally reached a deal to re - open the government on monday , meaning that the days of relative stalemate had come to an at least partial end and federal employees could all return to work . because support staff are now able to return to work , president trump s previously scheduled trip to the world economic forum in switzerland this week is able to proceed without a hitch . cnn is now reporting , however , that the first lady , melania trump , will not be joining him on his trip , even though the administration had previously reported that she would . east wing communications director stephanie grisham cited scheduling and logistical issues as the reason for melania backing out of accompanying her husband overseas . grisham had previously told cnn that the first lady intended to attend the world economic forum in a show of support for her husband , who intends to give remarks during his visit . president trump , for his part , remains a controversial figure in contexts like the world economic forum , having long established himself as fiercely committed to his america first agenda through such means as slapping protectionist tariffs on foreign goods including , most recently , solar panels . vocally anti - trump solar company Now soLar was among the interests to issue a statement criticizing the president s decision , posting that they are devastated to learn trump has imposed a 30 tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry . as the company noted , solar energy industries association president and ceo abigail ross hopper commented that the tariffs will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving , which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard - working , blue - collar americans their jobs . stunningly , the seia states that the tariffs effectively will cause the loss of roughly 23 , 000 american jobs this year , including many in manufacturing , and it will result in the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars in solar investment . the tariffs were imposed after a complaint was filed by the two foreign - owned solar companies suniva and solarworld , and they re just one step in an already long history of the president deciding to go it alone instead of cooperating with our allies and accepting that foreigners aren t all out to get us . trump s protectionist , anti - globalization trade policies are the economic side to his racism , which holds that numerous foreigners pose some kind of existential threat to the u . s . other infamous instances of the president deciding to go it alone include his announcement of his intent to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord , although it takes more than a belligerent announcement from the president to make that happen . world economic forum president borge brende recently commented to cNbc that trump would do well to remember that you only succeed if others do well too . very pleased to welcome trump to davos : wef president from cNbc . the clashing of brende s and trump s perspectives will no doubt mark the president s time at the world economic forum this week . his past trips overseas have been marked by a similar clash , with him having long insisted including while overseas that the u . s . is doing too much on behalf of our allies and that others should do more . featured image via sauL Loeb / afp / getty images

while many of us may enjoy a bit of sushi here and there , this man took it to another level . sadly , this man ate sushi and sashimi every single day until a massive parasite slithered out of his body . this man was about 30 years old and from fresno california . he was experiencing severe cramps and bloody diarrhea when he decided a trip to the er was in order . the washington post recently did an interview with an emergency physician at the university of california at san francisco who treated this unfortunate man . the name of this emergency physician is kenny banh and boy did he have a story to share . you can click here to hear banh speak on the podcast this won t hurt a bit . hanh said that the man came in wanting to get treated for worms . this man had a bag with some of his worm inside of it . this worm was wrapped around a toilet paper roll and when it was stretched out measured almost 6 foot long when asked how he was able to extract the worm this man told bahn that he was having some problems in the bathroom and noticed a piece of what he thought was intestine hanging out of his bum . he began pulling on it and it just kept coming and coming . while the worm was dead when presented to banh the man claims it was still alive when he was pulling it out . while it is a great relief that the man s intestines weren t hanging out but the idea of a worm inside our bodies definitely is enough to make my skin crawl . now when it came to trying to determine where the man obtained his intestinal friend they determined that it was from eating this raw fish apparently one too many times . that being said , bahn also mentioned there was a warning about parasites in salmon not too long ago sent out by the cDc . now , if anyone is not familiar with tapeworms , they are long flat - worms that consist of segments . they live in our intestines when we have them and they can cause a lot of issues . click here to learn more about tapeworms in general . while it is a bit terrifying , it is important to know when things like this happen . be aware of the things going into your body , just because a restaurant has good food doesn t mean the food is risk - free .
for those who do not know this polar vortex we are currently facing here in the united states is a prevailing wind pattern that circles the arctic , it flows from west to east all the way around the earth . while it normally keeps cold air towards the north pole but sometimes this vortex becomes weak . because that vortex has become weak it is allowing the cold air to pour down across canada as well as the united states . this right in the middle of a bomb cyclone on the east coast has us all pretty damn cold . this deep freeze is similar to the one that caused severe temperatures across eastern us back in winter of 2016 . seems to be a patter more recently now doesn t it this storm itself has drawn several lobes of the polar vortex over the mid - atlantic and northeast , that means that cold air is going to be coming from siberia , the north pole , and greenland to where we are . a bomb cyclone for those who do not know is a storm that drops roughly 24 millibars of pressure over a 24 hour period . and what forecasters are worried about with this one is that the pressure levels could be on the same level as hurricane sandy . a bomb cyclone is essentially a winter ice hurricane , and it is great at pulling cold down from above . even in the first 12 / 28 entry offered , regardless of where this storm tracks , it was quite evident that everYthing pours in behind it . siberia , north pole , greenland . everything . severe cold snap behind this storm . think power may go start planning pic . twitter . com / ye85dphjcw crankyweatherguy ( crankywxguy ) january 1 , 2018 forecasts expect temperatures to be around 20 to 40 degrees below the normal marking this as the coldest winter so far . record cold temperatures will be met this weekend , so it it important to be aware of this and all that this storm has brought our way . the polar vortex is not something to take lightly . please do your best to stay as warm as you can . while the video below is a bit old it does a great job of explaining why we are cold in current times . the bomb cyclone did indeed shake things up causing the polar vortex to affect even us in the united states . as if the bomb cyclone wasn t already enough what do you think about all of this i for one will be staying inside as much as i can .
of course , fast food is convenient and we all love french fries , but we should not be eating the one from here . i know life can be a bit hectic but our health is extremely important . mcdonald s french fries are it seems as a whole our favorite , especially here in the us . this is because mcdonald s manipulates us into eating them . companies like mcdonald s have been profiting off of our ignorance for far too long , and it is high time that we put a stop to it the process taken to create these fries is nothing like you would expect . grant imahara a television star after working on mythbusters seems to now be working for mcdonald s as just a few years ago he starred in the video our food , your questions . this specific video going over exactly how mcdonald s fries are made . while it is not as shocking as some would want it to be i do need to go over a couple things . sure , these fries are made of potatoes , but they are also doused with sodium acid pyrophosphate sodium acid pyrophosphate is an ingredient in baking powders and is added to a lot of things we tend to ingest . things like canned fish and cured meats . with that being said , if we ingest too much of this a loss of bone mineral density , as well as loss of the ability to fully absorb dietary calcium , will become our reality . while it is not easy to gain the amount needed to cause damage it is also not as hard as people say it is . when things are becoming more and more reliant on this and other chemicals our daily intake is bound to increase . overconsuming foods that contain this can lead to severe osteoporosis . higher intakes of phosphorus , in general , have also been linked to kidney disease and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease . you see , the more phosphorus we eat the more our need for calcium rises as well . balance is needed big time . phosphates while in the form mentioned above are not much they can be an issue if you overindulge and let s be honest , we tend to overindulge . mcdonald s sells tons and tons of french fries daily . according to fastcodesign , americans actually consume on average almost 30 whole pounds of french fries per year . don t get me wrong , the food tastes great , but it is not good for us . the more things we continue to put into our bodies without researching them first the more fucked our lives will get . it is long past time for you to take your future into your own hands . please feel free to check out the videos below to see how these fries are made and learn more about the dangers of mcdonald s food .

we have all been on edge for quite some time anxiously waiting to see where all this tension between the us and north korea is going , right most of us have accepted that ww3 might very well be upon us . paul miller , former national security council member supporting the former president george w . bush as well as barack obama is bringing a lot of things to the light in more recent times . he did an interview with express and people everywhere are talking about it . during this interview , miller focused mostly on explaining how a war comparable to ww3 would unfold if it involved nuclear weapons in general . miller says that the first major changes we would notice would be changes that made communicating over the internet or satellite completely impossible . dividing the people is a very important task when it comes to these things . once no one can communicate properly a series of standoff attacks with missiles and bombers would most likely come next . miller said the longer those conflicts carried on the more imminent the nuclear explosions would be . ww3 would be something that happens slowly , not overnight . that being said , even miller himself pointed out that he could be wrong about all of this . miller believes avoiding war is a good idea . miller also believes that the war would not come from north korea but from elsewhere . writing for foreign policy , he said : four years ago , i predicted russia s invasion of ukraine . here s my next prediction , which by now will strike many people as obvious : the baltics are next , and will pose one of president donald trump s first and greatest tests . putin will instigate an ambiguous militarised crisis using deniable proxies , probably in the next two years . perhaps russian - speaking latvians or estonians a quarter of latvians and estonians are ethnically russian will begin rioting , protesting for their rights , claiming to be persecuted , asking for international protection . a suspiciously well armed and well trained popular front for the liberation of the russian baltics will appear . a few high - profile assassinations and bond bombings bring the baltics to the edge of civil war . a low - grade insurgency may emerge . dr . miller added that putin and other russians who see the world through the lens of russian religious nationalism believe the west is inherently a threat because of its degeneracy and globalism . what do you think about all of this who do you think will start ww3 i for one could see it being us easily , especially with how things have been in more recent times .

as tensions grow , many believe the worst is to come . the cdc really has scheduled a briefing for later on this month to outline just how the public can prepare for any possible nuclear wars to come . most people do not know what they need to do in order to prepare for a nuclear war and being prepared is everything . if you are not prepared you will not last long . most people don t know what they should or shouldn t do and in regards to fallout let s face it we are never going to be prepared enough . while a nuclear detonation is unlikely , it would have devastating results and there would be limited time to take critical protection steps . despite the fear surrounding such an event , planning and preparation can lessen deaths and illness . for instance , most people don t realize that sheltering in place for at least 24 hours is crucial to saving lives and reducing exposure to radiation . while federal , state , and local agencies will lead the immediate response efforts , public health will play a key role in responding . this briefing will be presented by people who specialize in radiation studies and if you have been paying attention to president trump s tweets is something we should have had long ago . in an interview with pbS newshour s judy woodruff , former vice president joe biden said that he agrees with admiral mike mullen s statement that the us has literally nEvER been closer to a nuclear exchange with north korea . he believes nuclear war is almost inevitable and that it will be happening sooner rather than later . he claims there is no easy answer as to how to deal with the issues between the us and north korea and definitely no easy way to relieve tensions . when we engage in activities like let s compare the button , they all for different reasons and different motivations lose confidence in us . they wonder what the hell we re doing . i m worried they then decide they re going to try separate ways to figure out how to do this . this can t be done in a way that doesn t have all the players in the game on the same page and the other thing is you draw these lines and you don t respond , you diminish your credibility and it s just dangerous . if you haven t already begun preparing you should look into doing so . while i am not here to push fear into your heart or mind , it never hurts to be prepared .

it is in our water and even in our toothpaste and yet we don t pay very much attention to it . fluoride is a very serious problem and it is causing many detrimental health issues whether you want to accept that or not . for those who do not know , fluoride is a known carcinogen and is even listed by the merck index as the primary use being rat and cockroach poison . no , i am not joking , fluoride is truly deadly . the california environmental protection agency s office of environmental health hazard assessment ( oehha ) actually released a document in more recent times titled evidence on the carcinogenicity of fluoride and its salts . this document goes over the very apparent health hazards associated with the consumption of fluoride , their report states as follows : fluoride is the monovalent anion derived from the element fluorine . it is present in many salts , including sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride . when these salts are dissolved in water the free fluoride ion is released . fluoride salts or other compounds that release fluoride ion may be added to drinking water to prevent dental caries . fluoride - releasing compounds are also added for this purpose to a wide variety of dental products including toothpastes and mouthwashes . the public is exposed to fluoride ion by drinking fluoridated water and by using fluoride - containing dental products and treatments . exposure may also occur through naturally present fluoride in foods and beverages , and in some cases by inhalation of fluoride compounds in the air . there are numerous studies in the published scientific literature investigating the potential carcinogenicity of fluoride . the human evidence consists primarily of epidemiological studies ( ecological , cohort , and case - control ) comparing cancer risks in exposed versus unexposed individuals . one ecologic study ( cohn , 1992 ) and one hospital - based case - control study ( bassin et al . , 2006 ) have reported increases in osteosarcomas in young males exposed to fluoride in drinking water . the possibility that chance , bias , inappropriate analyses or confounding played a role in these findings could not be ruled out , however . the animal evidence consists of several drinking water and diet studies conducted in rats and mice . statistically significant increases in rare malignant bone tumors ( osteosarcomas ) were observed in male rats in drinking water studies conducted by the national toxicology program ( ntp , 1990 ) , but not in female rats or male or female mice similarly exposed . a statistically significant dose - related increase in thyroid tumors ( adenomas and carcinomas , combined ) was also observed in this male rat study ( ntp , 1990 ) . these findings were not replicated in a subsequent ntp study in male rats of the same strain receiving a somewhat higher fluoride dose , also via drinking water ( ntp , 1992 ) . increases in benign osteomas were observed in two - year diet studies in male and female cd - 1 mice ( maurer et al . , 1993 ) . however , the possible contribution of retroviral infection reported in the male and female mice to the development of osteomas could not be ruled out . no treatment - related tumor findings were observed in two - year diet studies conducted in male and female sprague - dawley rats ( maurer et al . , 1990 ) . pharmacokinetic studies of fluoride show that fluoride ion is readily taken up and incorporated into bones and teeth of humans and laboratory animals . comparison of fluoride pharmacokinetics between humans and rodents indicates that rodents must be exposed to much higher levels of fluoride in diet or water than humans to achieve the same levels of bone fluoride levels . water fluoridation has been happening for many many years and throughout those years the question of its effectiveness and safety has been brought up on more than one occasion . it is something that you could consider to be highly controversial . there was a study done back in the 1990 s on lab animals that showed there was evidence of cancer - causing potential in fluoridated drinking water . as mentioned above , there was a higher number of cases of bone cancer in the rats drinking it . we are essentially drinking ourselves to death . in his book fluoride , the aging factor dr . john yiamouyiannis wrote as follows : fluoride is a poison it has been used as a pesticide for mice , rats , and other small pests . a 10 - pound infant could be killed by 1 / 100 of an ounce and a 100 - pound adult could be killed by 1 / 10 of an ounce of fluoride . if that isn t enough to get you feeling a bit off about there being fluoride in your water then i don t know what would . one study back in 2005 conducted at the harvard school of dental health actually found a strong correlation between fluoride and you guessed it , bone cancer . sodium fluoride inhibits enzyme activity and paralyzes white blood cells . there are actually around 500 peers reviewed studies going over the adverse effects of fluoride .
for the first time since october of 2013 , a very serious issue has occurred . the us government has literally shutdown . no , this does not mean what most people assume it means , but it is cause for alarm and can turn into a much more sErious issue if something does not give . this shutdown technically occurred on saturday ( midnight ) when congress and president trump failed to reach a deal on funding for federal agencies . democrats had insisted that any bill to renew government funding also contain permanent protection for about 700 , 000 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the us as children . for those who are not aware just last week , president trump rejected a bipartisan senate deal that would have done exactly that and even given the white house almost 3 billion dollars in new money for immigration enforcement at the borders . just minutes before the funding deal deadline late friday night the white house issued a statement that blamed democrats for the shutdown . we will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while democrats hold our lawful citizen s hostage over their reckless demands . this shutdown became very real when the senate meeting last night blocked a bill to maintain the federal government s funding through february 16 th . the vote was 50 - 49 and needed 60 to vault the bill over that hurdle . currently , it looks like the whole ordeal in itself is a blame game from one to the other as to why this shutdown happened . some have even gone so far as to say that trump was rooting for the shutdown . however , according to politico , trump and schumer were actually quite close to making a deal . democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border . they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead . weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) january 20 , 2018 this will be called the trumpshutdown . there is no one who deserves the blame for the position we find ourselves in more than president trump . pic . twitter . com / wE3sh9tprU chuck schumer ( senschumer ) january 20 , 2018 cnbc reported as follows on this issue : in remarks following mcconnell s comments , schumer said he was willing to compromise with trump on an immigration agreement and said he thought he had a deal with the president during a white house meeting friday . the senator contended that trump backed off of a possible immigration solution when he faced pressure from conservatives . now all of this problem is because republican leadership can t get to yes because president trump refuses to . mr . president , president trump , if you are listening , i am urging you : please take yes for an answer , he said , adding that the blame should crash entirely on the president s shoulders . while we aren t going to see much change today , but if this is not resolved soon the consequences will begin to show themselves . many government employees will be forced to stay home from work on furlough . state parks and so forth will most likely close and even processing passport applications will be put on hold . while the essentials will not be affected on our country as a whole and the public this will be a huge problem if things continue as they are . anything with outside funding will stay operational and no , the military will not disappear . for more information on this please check out the videos below . this is something we all need to be aware of and regardless of who is to blame it is a problem that needs to be dealt with . i am a bit nervous to see how this whole thing pans out .

could you imagine waking up in the morgue i for one would be traumatized for life a 29 - year - old prisoner by the name of gonzalo montoya jimenez was found unresponsive in his cell during a morning roll call and had been transferred to a hospital mortuary , literally in a body bag . spanish prison authorities were not expecting what happened next . this man was declared dead by three different doctors before he finally woke up in the morgue . jimenez was serving time for robbery in asturias central penitentiary in north - west spain . he was first seen by two doctors at the prison who just so happened to be on duty and then inspected hours later by a forensic doctor . this meaning he was reported dead and verified as so on three separate occasions . yet , hours before his autopsy was set to begin , pathologists realized they were hearing something strange from within his body bag : snoring . el spanol reported as follows on the matter : the body of prisoner montoya was sent in a closed bag to the institute of legal medicine to perform an autopsy . while from the prison they were in charge of contacting the relatives of the supposed deceased to communicate the news , the body arrived at the place where the autopsy would be done . the surprise - may scula - arrived when forensic doctors [ the pathologists ] began to hear noises coming from inside the bag . montoya was not dead . quite the opposite . the forensics [ pathologists ] proceeded to open the bag and found the inmate still alive . thus , the inmate was transferred to the central university hospital of asturias in an ambulance , reports la voz de asturias . at the end of the day last sunday , montoya was still admitted and escorted by civil guard agents . on the eve of the event , the day of kings , the prisoner was indisposed . as the local press advances , an investigation has been opened to clarify the causes surrounding the resurrection of montoya . there is an investigation underway over this as the lucky man did , in fact , manage to come to before going under the knife . a spokesman for the hospital he is currently staying at has confirmed that he is in intensive care at this point but was not able to comment on his condition . relatives have been visiting him during his hospital stay and are feeling quite odd about the whole ordeal . in time we will know whether proper procedures were followed or not . what do you think about all of this
have you ever seen something or someone you just couldn t explain it seems the people of chicago are experiencing something quite surreal . according to the chicagotribune , there have been an awful lot of mothman sightings in recent times . they say that some people believe it looks like a bat or owl where - as the rest claim it looks more man - like . perhaps even a man in a winged suit of some kind . reports seem to note that the creature has glowing red eyes and that in the presence of this interesting beast they feel a deep sense of overwhelming dread . paranormal researcher lon strickler of pennsylvania told the chicagotribune over the phone that he believed these people were in - fact seeing something . he says that because the descriptions do not all quite match there could be at least two or more different creatures present . there have allegedly been around 50 something sightings of this mothman just in 2017 alone . one of those being a man named john amitrano who worked security at a popular hangout . he told VicE that he saw a flying plane and then something moving somewhat awkwardly underneath that plane . he claims it did not look much like a bat and seemed to look more like a pterodactyl . he said i know what birds and what bats look like . this thing didn t have any feathers or fur , and it didn t fly like anything i ve ever seen . this creature he saw seemed to have a human - like shape and flew in a strange swooping motion up and down . the chicagoreader , a local news source reported that most of these mothman spottings have occurred near lake michigan . that being said , whether you believe there is an actual mothman out there or not , if there is he or she has not been hurting anyone that we know of . some people believe there has to be a logical explanation for these sightings and others are completely convinced that the mothman does exist . what do you think

donald trump cast himself as a supposedly amazing deal maker while coming into office , promising to restore america s position in the world , but in reality , he s only caused our position in the world to worsen in the minds of many . instead of the respected leader we once were , under the trump administration , the united states at least its government has devolved into even more of an apparent laughingstock than it was before . a new report from bloomberg outlines just how such has come about in the case of our relationship with the united kingdom . according to the publication , trump hasn t limited his whining about the treatment he receives from the press to his public statements , including those offered on twitter . rather , according to bloomberg , during a phone conversation with british prime minister theresa may last year , trump went so far as to complain to the british leader about the negative coverage of him in the british press . he apparently insisted at the time that he wouldn t be accepting the u . k . s offer of a state visit unless may could assure him that he would receive a warm welcome . may could do no such thing at least without the u . s . president actually changing his public behavior and since then , trump announced that he had cancelled his plans to make a visit to the u . k . , although the visit he cancelled entailed him being on hand for the opening of the new u . s . embassy in the u . k . and wasn t just the ceremonial state visit that he had been offered . additionally , trump made up a reason for cancelling his visit to london that was not even based in reality , claiming that it was because he didn t approve of the obama administration having sold the u . s . embassy in london for peanuts . the obama administration didn t sell the u . s . embassy in london ; that transaction was carried out under the bush administration . london mayor sadiq khan , the first muslim to lead the city , commented on trump announcing the cancelling of his plans to come to london by saying : it appears that president trump got the message from the many londoners who love and admire america and americans but find his policies and actions the polar opposite of our city s values of inclusion , diversity and tolerance . with londoners having chosen to elect a muslim man as their mayor , and trump having long touted the supposed necessity of a ban on muslims from entering the u . s . , why exactly does he think that the people of britain will be fond of the idea of him coming on a state visit remember too , trump ignited fury across the united kingdom when he retweeted anti - muslim posts from a far right radical activist . he responded to criticism by training his twitter sights on pm may , writing that may should focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom . bloomberg reports that through all of this , the offer of a state visit still stands , but adds that british officials don t expect him to take it up any time soon , or perhaps ever . how incompetent do you have to be to ruin our relationship with the united kingdom featured image via thomas lohnes / getty images
the trump administration has insisted , again and again , that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia . despite a disorganized campaign rife with russian - affiliated individuals and criminals , trump has stood firm on this issue . now , it appears the tune may be changing . at a press conference today , sarah sanders let slip that it s possible people in the campaign but not trump colluded with russia . in a tense exchange with maggie haberman of the new york times , sarah sanders was asked what collusion means to the trump administration , and then whether trump speaks for himself or everyone on the campaign . maggie opened her line of questioning with , the president has said repeatedly there there was no collusion between the campaign and russia . do you define what he means when he says collusion is he talking about meetings between officials is he talking about information exchanging hands what does that mean to which sarah sanders responded : i think the accusation against the president is that he had help winning the election and that s simply untrue . the president won because he was the better candidate , because he worked harder , because he had a message that america actually cared about and believed in , and came out in a historic fashion and supported and voted for him . that s why he won . it wasn t because of some made - up hoax that has been created to delegitimize this president . it s because he was the best candidate at the right time that america wanted to see , and that s why he s in the oval office today . it s hard to know where to start with that pile of drivel . first , america voted overwhelmingly for hillary clinton , who won the popular vote by what was truly a historic amount . the only thing historic about donald trump s victory was losing the popular vote by a greater margin than every other winning president who lost it combined and then multiplied by two . there has never been a winner who loses like trump . the next question sanders faced was , does he think the reporting from the intelligence community saying that there was hacking that went on , done by russia , he rejects that no . he s addressed that , but that doesn t mean that he participated in it . i think those are very different things . stating the existence of something happening is very different than having helped make it happen . and you can t conflate the two , and i think oftentimes that s what individuals are trying to do . it s notable here that her statement directly contradicts the first thing she said , which was that trump didn t have help . now she s acknowledging that the russians helped trump , but stating that he didn t cooperate with them or communicate with them or have anything to do with it . of course , that doesn t explain the now - infamous trump tower meeting , multiple meetings with the russian ambassador that trump s flunkies repeatedly lied about , or trump s shady money connections with russia . it doesn t explain why trump publicly called for russia to hack hillary clinton s emails , and it doesn t explain why he refused to enact sanctions even after signing a bill ( passed by a veto - proof majority ) that made it law . it also doesn t explain why donald trump has repeatedly stated that he believes putin over the intelligence community , except when under great pressure . finally , she was asked the coup de grace : does he mean that about himself , or about campaign officials look , i think he s stating for himself and to anything that he would be a part of or know about , or have sanctioned . this reads as yeah , people may have colluded , but trump himself had nothing to do with it . every week , the story changes . it remains to be seen what the truth is , but one thing is for sure : it isn t the trump administration s ever - evolving story . you can watch the press conference in full below . the remarks in question begin at approximately the hour - and - a - half mark : featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images
north america has a compassionate leader - in - chief , he just does not happen to be donald trump . apparently , the u . s . cannot rent canada s prime minister justin trudeau for the next three years , as one person tweeted . yet , it is an idea we release with reluctance . the shooting tragedy in a kentucky high school brought home how badly we need someone like trudeau . the canadian prime minister took a moment to phone the governor of kentucky , matt bevin , to offer his condolences . then , he took another moment to tweet to the people of that great state : i ve spoken with kentucky s govmattbevin to offer condolences on behalf of canadians for today s shooting in benton . our hearts go out to kentuckians , and to all those affected by this tragedy . trudeau offers condolences after the kentucky school shooting , the eleventh one this year . donald trump said nothing , nada , zero , zilch . two students in the western kentucky high school died and many others were injured when a 15 - year - old boy walked in with a handgun . he continued shooting until a sheriff s deputy stopped his massacre . some students remain in critical condition . governor bevin held a news conference after the incident and said the shooter was a student who now faces murder and attempted murder charges . according to the washington post , he said : this is a wound that is going to take a long time to heal and for some in this community , it will never heal . white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders told reporters in the daily briefing that they had briefed trump on the shooting . she said in a throw - away line that he offered thoughts and prayers for the victims and their families , then she added : the students did exactly as they were trained . everybody at that high school reacted appropriately . she also indicated that the students had recently been trained on how to react to an active shooter in their school . that was not quite the heartfelt message u . s . people were seeking from their leader or even their press secretary . it seems that donald trump missed that in his education , the part where he learned about how to be a leader . it is hard for people to follow someone who appears to not care if they drop dead . senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r ) hails from kentucky . he took time to speak about the incident from the senate floor : our hearts are with the entire community in marshall county and our gratitude is with the first responders who rushed into harm s way . students said the shooter made his way to the atrium , where they congregated . baleigh culp said : there was bullets flying everywhere . i ran straight out the door and headed to the highway as fast as i could . the county attorney in marshall county , jeff edwards went to the school after the shooting . he said : to walk in , the backpacks laying around , the phones laying around , going off . . . it s indescribable . i ve been doing this for 25 years . it s not like anything i ve experienced in my life . the gunshot injuries varied in their seriousness . five boys ranging from 15 through 18 were wounded . one of the teenagers had a head wound , another had a chest and abdomen wounds , and a third had an arm wound . too bad , the tweeter - in - chief could not be bothered to lift his phone to sent his expression of grief to the citizens of kentucky . then again , maybe the administration should just hire someone to do compassion . featured images via getty images .
when former secretary of health and human services tom price resigned , the race was on to confirm a new secretary and go through another round of confirmation hearings . on wednesday , the senate confirmed price s replacement alex azar . azar was the executive of eli lilly , and it s important to note he s no friend to cheap drug prices . during his tenure there , drug prices went up significantly . however , he told senators during the confirmation that the cost of medication was too high . the washington post reported : at his senate financing hearing earlier this month , azar testified that prescription drugs cost too much and said that he favors efforts to promote more competition among manufacturers . he doesn t support , however , the negotiation of drug costs within medicare . this is also not his first time serving in the dept . of health and human services . he was deputy secretary during president george w . bush s administration . according to the washington post : wednesday s vote marked the third time that azar has won senate confirmation . early in the george w . bush administration , he was confirmed as hhs general counsel . at the start of bush s second term , he was confirmed again as the department s deputy secretary , a position he held for two years until leaving for the private sector . so , at least the guy has experience maybe according to sen . orrin hatch ( r - ut ) , he was a great pick for the job . i can think of very few others as qualified to take the helm of this very large ship . with experience both on the company side and the government side of health care , he is now only more experienced and knowledgeable . six democrats joined republicans in confirming azar . they included sens . heidi heitkamp , doug jones , tom carper , joe donnelly , christopher coons , and joe manchin . only one republican voted to block his nomination , and that was sen . rand paul ( r - ky ) . back in november , paul went off on azar during his hearing . trump s original choice for sec . of health and human services , tom price , resigned in shame after it was found he had spent around 400 , 000 on trips using private planes . despite his experience , azar has a full plate ahead of him with an ongoing epidemic of opioid abuse , the trump administration s attack on the affordable care act , and the creeping of conservatism into health care . under trump s administration , the conscience and religious freedom division in the hhs office for civil rights was created to protect religious organizations who object to paying for medical services that may infringe upon their religious beliefs . ocr s director roger severino said : for too long , governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection , but change is coming and it begins here and now . so far , trump has had approximately 100 nominees sent back to him with democrats blocking their nominations . democrats have claimed that several of those nominated were far too inexperienced for the job . sen . tom carper ( d - de ) ) commented : unqualified or controversial nominees will not simply be rubber - stamped by the senate republicans , however , have accused democrats of simply obstructing the nomination process . sen . james lankford ( r - oK ) commented : it definitely violates precedent . that s just a sign of the times that people are looking for a rule to be able to slow the senate down even more that s making a bad situation worse . featured image by win mcnamee / getty images .
we ve all seen how the ascent of donald trump to power has resulted in bigots with even more incendiary viewpoints than his own being seemingly let off the chain and allowed to roam about with more freedom than before . for instance , in perhaps the most infamous example of this , white nationalists , led in part by richard spencer , descended upon a virginia town late last year to protest the city s plans to remove a statue honoring the slaveholder general robert e . lee . that weekend of protests ended with three dead . now , the increased openness with which the trump administration has approached white nationalist causes is rearing its head in a striking and disturbing way . five gop congressmen are reportedly taking a trip overseas this week to meet with the leader of a hungarian political party that , among other things , is known for its parliamentary secretary having calling for the gassing of jews , gays , and roma . the incendiary figure in question with whom the congressmen will meet is tomio okamura , leader of the movement of freedom and direct democracy ( spd ) . the five u . s . congressmen reportedly going on the trip include reps . steve king , andy harris , dana rohrabacher , louie gohmert , and paul gosar . a hungarian news outlet reports that okamura published a press release stating that he and the congressmen will discuss topics of bi - lateral and global importance , including european policy which concerns demographic changes , migration and immigration . ironically , the revelation of this meeting comes in the wake of the debate over immigration policy in the u . s . having reached such a fever pitch that the federal government shut down for three days because democrats didn t want to move forward on a spending measure without ensuring continued protections for the young people protected under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program , which the trump administration has moved to end . among the interests to have so far spoken out against the congressmen reportedly planning to meet with okamura is european media director of the human rights watch andrew stroehlein , who commented of what he called a a trans - atlantic hatemonger hoedown for unscrupulous politicians trying to boost their careers by driving people to fear and despise others : these us congressmen have chosen to meet with tomio okamura who is well known for calling for the banning of islam and external manifestations of islam . the spd s parliamentary party secretary has called for the gassing of jews , gays and roma . i would wonder if the congressmen know who they re meeting with , but then , i see steve king is part of this us delegation . king is known for his own racist statements and open opposition to religious freedom and he s also a fan of other infamous xenophobes in europe , like geert wilders and marine le pen , so this is just par for the course with him , sadly . it doesn t take very long at all to find examples of king s racism , as referenced by stroehlein . in march of last year , responding to a tweet that presumably contained comments from dutch politician geert wilders but has since been deleted , king wrote : wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny . we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies . as for okamura s political party , a report came out late last year detailing multiple witness accounts of a drunken sexist tirade from jaroslav stan k , secretary for the party . as hungarian mp marek ernoch described it : he demanded that all homosexuals , roma , and jews should be shot immediately after they have been born . he also verbally attacked the women that were present with gross insults . this is the group that five current members of the u . s . congress are reportedly meeting with this week . let that sink in . the president will no doubt never utter a word against the trip if he hears about it , with his own past chock full of racism and sexism . featured image via tom williams / cQ roll call
donald trump has been in office for just over one year at this point , which is long enough for there to be at least preliminary data about the state of american society under his leadership . trump made bold promises upon coming into office , some of which weren t based in reality , such as his claim that foreign oriented terrorism poses a threat to the u . s . large enough to warrant a racially charged ban on muslims entering the u . s . unsurprisingly , attorney general jeff sessions public stance is that trump has proven remarkably effective in making his promises to make america more secure a reality . he communicated this stance in an article published this week in usa today a news media organization that is , notably , not among the ones continually attacked by the president for supposedly peddling fake news . sessions cast his comments in the context of trump s promise , made during his inaugural address , to end the american carnage supposedly wracking our cities . trump s inaugural address , it s worth noting , was viewed suspiciously by an array of interests for its dark , ultra - nationalist undertones . sessions began his piece published in the usa today : when president trump was inaugurated , he made the american people a promise : this american carnage stops right here and stops right now . it is a promise that he has kept . this sounds great , but there s an almost strikingly obvious hole in both sessions and trump s arguments . sessions issued his piece in the usa today on the occasion of the release of preliminary data from the fBi about violent crime rates in the first half of 2017 , which showed a decrease relative to the year before . as he notes , rates of violent crime plummeted throughout the decades of the modern era , including in most the years of the obama administration , excluding the last two . there is a very good explanation for the uptick in crime in the final years of the obama administration , with the murder rate going up starkly in a few locales , such as chicago , a trend that s slowly but surely being turned around by city leaders . the rate of overall crime continued its overall decline in the final years of the obama administration . sessions argument , though , is that trump is responsible for the violent crime rate decrease , even though that leaves out the fact that it decreased under most of the years of the obama administration as well . without a more detailed analysis , you might as well say that the decrease in violent crime in 2017 had nothing to do with trump at all , seeing as it parallels the decreases in violent crime recorded in other years . sessions wasn t finished , though . he went on to write : trump ran for office on a message of law and order , and he won . when he took office , he ordered the department of justice to stop and reverse these trends and that is what we have been doing every day for the past year . we have placed trust in our prosecutors again , and we re restoring respect for law enforcement . we have invested in new resources and put in place smarter policies based on sound research . claiming that trump ran for office on a message of law and order is short - sighted at best . trump s platform could better be described as brute force , with him seeking to impose his will on the nation s security systems , through such means as a muslim ban and a wall in between us and mexico , no matter what the cost . in spite of these facts , the trump administration continues to push on with the narrative that there was a massively out of control crime rate and that the president has proven to be some kind of pseudo - messianic savior , with administration officials using this narrative as an excuse to push their draconian policies . featured image via alex wong / getty images
the internet is definitely one of the biggest threats to children and teens in the modern day world . it puts their mental health , safety , and innocence at risk and this new facebook trend has parents stressed out of their minds all around the us a new online trend has parents scrambling to make sure their kids are safe . what is it well , it s a new online game called the forty - eight - hour challenge . the game requires the player to pretend to go missing for forty - eight hours and follow a point currency to gain the most amount of points possible . as if the internet wasn t already a terrible threat to kids , you see something like this occur . lee tuttle , charlotte - mecklenburg police department s missing person s investigator , told wsoc - tv : it s just a terrible strain , emotionally , physically on these families . we were talking about it amongst our unit and we all cringed as soon as we heard something like that . it s disturbing because it s something we take so seriously , and for someone to take it as a prank or a joke is very alarming . the game rules require the player to pretend to go missing for forty - eight hours and reappear in two days . the player must not be active on facebook instagram , snap chat , or any other social media platform . the player is also not allowed to notify parents , loved ones , or friends . whenever someone shares a missing persons facebook post , share an update , or reports the person missing the are rewarded points . the point of the game essentially to worry the pants off the parents . the prank originated as a game called game of 72 that was popular across northern europe om 2015 where kids would fake their disappearances for 12 - 72 hours . the daily mail reports that there were children as young a fourteen playing this game i can t imagine being a parent and finding out my kid was playing this kind of trick on me . children often do it in groups or pairs as a dare . many people , especially children , go missing every single day . at any given moment there are over 100 , 000 open missing person reports in the united states . this game is cruel not only for the parents of the players but for the parents of kids who ve actually disappeared . a 12 - year - old girl from hull was reported missing by her grandmother only to return 2 days later . her grandmother now believes that her granddaughter took part in this horrible challenge : she is frightened now and i think she is starting to realize what she has done wrong . she didn t know about this challenge . we told her about it and i do believe her but there are other girls in her school who are on facebook . playing this game only makes it harder for parents , teachers , police officers , and search teams to find kids who are actually missing . if you suspect that your kid might play this game , be sure to make it clear that it is not okay , nor is it a game . it s a serious obstruction of justice and could very well end badly . perhaps the policeman that investigated it lost the chance of finding a real missing person . facebook claims to be looking into the issue the safety of young people on facebook is a responsibility we take extremely seriously and we are awaiting the links to investigate these reports to ensure we are able to take swift action if it is needed . we work closely with safety experts including the Nspcc , the uK safer internet centre , missing people , child net and much more to help young people have a positive experience on facebook , and collaborate closely with law enforcement agencies on issues regarding child safety . please share this with everyone you know . it is high time that we put an end to these horrible online challenges featured image via anon - hQ . outside sources for this article include : anon - hQ , metro . co and daily mail .

just last week , on christmas morning , children across the country excitedly tore open their christmas gifts revealing toys , electronics , and items from their wish list . for parents that may have included a number of glittery and bedazzled makeup kits from popular retailer claire s , the days that have followed have been filled with outrage , anger , and disgust . after purchasing one such makeup kit rhode island mother kristi warner was concerned about the ingredients that it may have contained . working for the deaton law firm in east providence , she was well aware of the risks of potential contaminants in cosmetics used by all ages and wanted to be safe before allowing her 6 - year old daughter to use the product . packaging up the kit , she sent it to an independent lab in north carolina for in - depth testing . when the lab contacted her with the results she was both shocked and appalled . the test results revealed that the makeup contained tremolite asbestos , a fatal , toxic , cancer - causing material . acknowledging that this could be a much bigger problem with a wide - spread impact warner , along with her boss john deaton , purchased 17 different kits from 9 different states , sending them all to be tested for the contaminant . the results sean fitzgerald of the scientific analytical institute , the scientist responsible for carrying out the testing , discovered the tremolite asbestos in every product tested . warner and deaton spoke with wjar - tV , looking for the media s assistance in sharing the frightening results with other parents . warned stated , the fact that the majority of the products came from the store shelves in the last two weeks means that there are other children being exposed . in response to the test results , claire s issued the following statement on december 22 nd : at claire s the safety of our customers is of paramount importance , and we are passionate about the safety and integrity of our products . we work closely with our vendors to ensure our products are tested and assessed in line with the relevant country regulations and guidelines . as a result of today s inquiry from wjar - tV , we have taken the precautionary measure of pulling the items in question from sale , and will be conducting an immediate investigation into the alleged issues . once we have more information and have the results of the investigation we will take the necessary action . they then released the following updates , on december 27 th : we have retained an independent laboratory to test the cited products in order to determined whether the recent news reports are accurate . in the interim , we have stopped sales of the products and are issuing full refunds to concerned customers . as always , the safety of our customers and products is our top priority . and on december 29 th : the initial results of testing by an independent certified laboratory show that the cosmetics tested to date are asbestos free . out of an abundance of caution , additional testing is underway . we have also confirmed that the talcum ingredient supply is from a certified asbestos free european vendor . we will continue to honor returns for any customers remaining uncomfortable . many parents took to twitter to express their outrage with the situation . while the recent update may claim that the products are asbestos free , their investigation isn t enough to assure a great number of concerned parents that these products are , in fact , safe for their children to use . after all , for this claim to be true warner and denton would have had to purchase the only 17 affected products across the country . many call for further independent investigation , while others are already demanding a class action lawsuit . the full list of products in question can be viewed here .
on wednesday , president trump invited mayors from around the country to a reception at the white house , where he would speak about his ongoing initiatives and policies that his administration has adopted to date . in the midst of his return from davos , switzerland , following on the heels of a three day government shutdown , the president attempted to boast the prosperity and growth that the country has experienced since he assumed office . although various mayors did attend the meeting , a host of democratic mayors declined from accepting the invitation , citing the recent escalation of attacks from the justice department against sanctuary cities around the country . those who declined the reception included new orleans mayor mitch landrieu , new york city mayor bill de blasio , as well as those who directly received letters from the justice department demanding greater compliance with the federal immigration policies . trump addressed those who did boycotted the reception at the beginning of his speech , as he stated that those who decided not to attend were putting the criminal activities of illegal immigrants before the safety and security of their own cities , an attack he so commonly makes . it was my great honor to welcome mayor s from across america to the wh . my administration will always support local government and listen to the leaders who know their communities best . together , we will usher in a bold new era of peace and prosperity < URL > pic . twitter . com / rsv7v7r0dt donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) january 24 , 2018 during the speech , the president commented on his supposedly landmark accomplishments in lower unemployment rates among minorities , and boasted of having the most regulation cuts of any administration in his first year , a questionable achievement , which may not be as positive as he believes . specifically , he mentioned the immediate increase in jobs after taking office through the building of the dakota access and keystone Xl pipelines , an issue that has caused backlash from environmental activists . responses to trump s attempted claim of a new era of peace and prosperity , as outlined in his twitter post , were rife with ridicule and criticism by social media users : i will not be attending today s meeting at the white house after realdonaldtrump s department of justice decided to renew their racist assault on our immigrant communities . it doesn t make us safer and it violates america s core values . bill de blasio ( nycmayor ) january 24 , 2018 denver doesn t violate federal law , and we won t be intimidated . and on the same day he has the audacity to invite mayors to the wh to discuss infrastructure . no , won t be going to the wh today , better things to do than be part of a photo op for 45 as he threatens cities again . michael b . hancock ( mayorhancock ) january 24 , 2018 my statement regarding the doj ' s letter on immigration laws . pic . twitter . com / 5 gnweakl94 mayor greg fischer ( louisvillemayor ) january 24 , 2018 odds he asked if this " mayor ' s " was coming pic . twitter . com / fZilajinbr danny deraney ( dannyderaney ) january 24 , 2018 the plural of " mayor " is " mayors " . you do not need an apostrophe . if you are going to represent one of the world ' s great nations , you would do well to acquire a better grasp of basic grammar . queenie goldstein ( queenieg2017 ) january 24 , 2018 he wrote this . notice that extra apostrophe that makes him feel smart because punctuation . rick ( fanboyrick ) january 24 , 2018 he has the best grammar . nobody speaks better english , believe me . matthew cesnik ( chez_mate ) january 24 , 2018 this is the second time we ' ve elected a charismatic man with outright dementia who passed his physical exam . reagan was far less along and far less obvious than the current alzheimerspatientinchief pic . twitter . com / trsZ80uhr1 forever logical ( foreverlogical ) january 24 , 2018 day 369 of the hostage situation . evil captor who is usually is keenly aware of how he is perceived , welcomes many hostage leaders who hate him , then departs for world leader meeting , where he is also hated magnificent bitch ( magsbitchs ) january 24 , 2018 you use apostrophes like you try to build walls : in the wrong place and for the wrong reasons . trump ' s ties ( trumpsties ) january 24 , 2018 jeezus , what grade did the person who posted this tweet finish jean theresistance ( jsc1835 ) january 24 , 2018 will your administration als ' o support bas ' ic literacy a first step would be to find someone who can teach you when to use apostrophes ( not apostrophe ' s ) and upper -

it was evident that 2017 was one of the worst years on record for natural disasters . whether it was the wildfires that raged through all of california , or the destructive hurricanes that devastated places like houston and puerto rico , it seemed as if each new day brought another threat for natural disasters . among the most significant of these was the aforementioned hurricanes which hit hard in houston , puerto rico , and the u . s . virgin islands , as three massive storms destroyed much of the infrastructure and livelihood of people living in the affected areas . whereas president trump made meager efforts at assisting those in houston , he received significant backlash for his disregard of puerto rico after hurricane irma ravaged the country , knocking out power grids and crumbling homes . the president made his thoughts on the situation blatant , as he repeatedly disparaged the mayor of san juan , yulin cruz , for daring to hold the administration accountable . according to a string of twitter posts put out by trump , cruz was apparently being influenced by democrats to be critical of his administration , and that her leadership abilities were poor . the mayor of san juan , who was very complimentary only a few days ago , has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump . donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) september 30 , 2017 such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan , and others in puerto rico , who are not able to get their workers to help . they . donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) september 30 , 2017 want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort . 10 , 000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job . donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) september 30 , 2017 while the current president was using the horrific disasters as a means of garnering support for himself , former presidents banded together to provide aid to the ravaged areas , including houston , the caribbean , and as well as florida after being hit by hurricane irma . titled the one america appeal , all five living presidents launched the initiative after hurricane harvey in houston , and expanded their efforts to the other disaster - stricken regions once the excessive damage was seen . the initiative has since raised roughly 41 million , and included famed donors such as lady gaga , the walton family foundation , the Nfl foundation , and an array of others . oaa has concluded fundraising with over 41 million raised from over 110 , 000 donors assisting hurricane relief efforts in tX , fl , pr and usvi . fmr presidents carter , bush ( 41 ) , clinton , bush ( 43 ) and obama thank each donor who contributed . more info at : < URL > pic . twitter . com / rpdz1n6gzx one america appeal ( americaappeal ) january 24 , 2018 a statement by the initiative said that the money was raised by a total of more than 110 , 000 donors to be distributed to organizations and groups that are on the front lines of rebuilding the impacted regions . according to a chron report , donations from the campaign have been distributed to the houston harvey relief fund , the rebuild texas fund , the florida disaster fund , unidos por puerto rico and the community foundation of the virgin islands . the initiative hit a landmark milestone in late october , when a fundraising concert held at texas a m university in college station was attended by the five former presidents . that night , the relief fund totaled their donations to roughly 31 million . after having amounted their total funds to roughly 41 million to date , the initiative claimed that they will not be accepting any more donations . president trump , despite having shown little respect or support for the people in these regions , lauded the former presidents for having raised such a significant amount of money . after the concert at texas a m , trump published a video message that america will return stronger than before from the hurricanes , making no mention of puerto rico or u . s . virgin islands in his remarks . while some show their fitness for leadership even after leaving a position of power , others show that they were never fit for it in the first place . featured image by getty images

with congress in shambles , an unfit leader at the helm , and a vast array of concerned and upset supporters , it is clear that vice president mike pence has had his work cut out for him in the first year of the trump administration . whether attempting to mitigate the controversies surrounding president trump , or having an active influence in congressional operations , pence seemingly has played a larger role than his recent predecessors , albeit one that has simultaneously been controversial as well . one aspect that has been a recurring task that pence has had to do can be seen in that of breaking ties that have so often come up in the senate since the beginning of the new administration . this is due to a variety of reasons , such as the republicans only holding a slight majority over democrats , senator john mccain s ( r - a . z . ) ongoing leaves due to his battle with brain cancer , as well as the reality that many gop lawmakers are not entirely in line with the radical rhetoric and policy proposals the current administration aims to implement . nevertheless , pence has acted as a saving grace for republicans aiming to get anything by the steadfast democratic senators , as his vote has been a tie - breaker in the chamber for the eighth time since taking the vice presidential role . on wednesday , pence broke a 49 - 49 tie in the senate to confirm kansas governor sam brownback ( r ) as the administration s ambassador - at - large for international religious freedom . the vote , interestingly enough , was the second one in the same day for brownback , as pence also had to end the debate on the governor s nomination earlier on wednesday . with senator bob corker ( r - t . n . ) in davos for the world economic forum , and senator john mccain ( r - a . z . ) on another leave due to his medical issues , the senate is essentially gridlocked until one of the two senators return . this is the infamous homophobic bigot that pence just broke a tie to confirm as the Us " religious freedom " ambassador . < URL > steve silberman ( stevesilberman ) january 24 , 2018 with the vote regarding brownback split directly down the middle along party lines , democrats made it clear why they vehemently opposed voting for him as the ambassador for religious freedom . according to a washington post report , president donald trump s selection of brownback for the state department post had come under fire from senate democrats and Lgbt rights groups . during his confirmation hearing last year , brownback declined to unequivocally declare there is no situation that would allow a country to cite religious freedom as the basis for criminally prosecuting Lgbt people . just a reminder that brownback is the guy who called same - sex marriage " a vast , social experiment " and warned it would " drive the marriage rates down . " but hey , let the guy run a state dept office in 2018 . < URL > jennifer bendery ( jbendery ) january 24 , 2018 america has always been about freedom , fairness and opportunity for all . that should be our message to the rest of the world but sam brownback won ' t deliver it and advance the cause of LgbtQ equality . sen . tammy baldwin ( senatorbaldwin ) january 24 , 2018 senator bob menendez ( d - n . j . ) claimed that he cannot support his former colleague in this role , due to the fact that his record on all religious beliefs is faulty , and that brownback may focus primarily on protecting christian minorities around the world , as opposed to people of all faiths . brownback , who was elected to the senate in 1996 and left in 2010 upon winning the gubernatorial election in his home state of kansas , is a devout catholic and was viewed as one of the more heavily conservative members of the senate during his tenure . democrats argue that his confirmation in the forthcoming role would be detrimental to religious minorities not of the christian faith , given the extreme mentalities brownback embodies . featured image by getty images
donald trump really loves taking credit for the accomplishments of others . if you think about it , that s his entire brand . aside from the couple of buildings which he actually owns , his business is putting his name on buildings built by other people in licensing deals . so it should come as no surprise when he attempts to take credit for the economic accomplishments of barack obama . president obama , who passed a stimulus package which saved the economy after the disastrous years under bush , built an economy that grew every single month for seven years straight , a trend which continues today . trump , who called the economic numbers fake right up until he started claiming responsibility for him , can t accept that . today , he tweeted out , will soon be heading to davos , switzerland , to tell the world how great america is and is doing . our economy is now booming and with all i am doing , will only get better our country is finally winning again here s the tweet : is now booming that s weird , because according to the numbers , trump has managed to do nothing but slow down an economy that was already booming : also , the last time republicans cut taxes for the extremely wealthy , they crashed the economy . trump is just like bush , but with the criminality of nixon . this entire presidency is stupid watergate . americans on social media were quick to hold trump accountable for his delusional statement : like most of his overseas trips , trump will undoubtedly embarrass our nation and himself ( not that he feels shame ) . the end of this criminal administration cannot be hastened enough . featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images
when donald trump announced his candidacy for the presidency , there were whispers of his being the most racist candidate in recent history . much has been made of his feelings towards black and hispanic populations both in the u . s . and abroad . trump took heat for calling african countries shitholes , for declaring that haitians all have aids , for not knowing that all welfare recipients aren t black , for suggesting that nigerian immigrants all live in huts , for saying that mexican immigrants are mostly criminals and rapists , and for implying that all black people are lazy ( see more exhaustive lists here and here . ) what s not been explored as fully is trump s role in the rise of hatred towards jewish people . many people assume that , because the united states won world war ii and destroyed nazi germany s institutionalized targeting of jews , antisemitism was defeated in the 1940 s . but it is becoming impossible to ignore that antisemitism is alive and well in the united states today . in modern america , hatred towards jews is veiled in a specialized language that may escape the notice of most citizens . you may have heard trump and his surrogates using terms like globalist . this is a coded way of referencing the influence of jews . historically attacked throughout thousands of years , jews became the target of caricatures , and were falsely represented as shrewd business people who pulled financial strings . stereotypes of jews were often tied to money , portraying jews as rich , yet stingy . since laws in the middle ages forbid christians from practicing moneylending , the main loan providers were jews . because of this , the connection between jews and business was strengthened . when analyzing the popularity of this term , google trends show that the month trump declared his candidacy , searches for globalist soared and hit the highest numbers ever . the average searches for this term never relaxed back to pre - trump averages . just look at random people on twitter embracing this ridiculous racist language : there are masonic halls in almost every town where i live . it amazes me how little people know about this group that works with zionism to manipulate and steer humanity into the jew globalist hands . punishedrealist ( progenitor_red ) january 23 , 2018 the jew , like any parasite , adapts . the jew embraces liberalism to push their globalist agenda and when the tide turns against liberalism , they embrace free market conservatism and make trillions on wall street to fund their satanic plans waiting for the tide to turn once again . kara von und zu eltz ( kvonundzueltz ) january 17 , 2018 where does trump fit into all of this to some , it s surprising that donald trump could accused of racism against jews , as his beloved daughter ivanka converted to judaism to marry jared kushner . but in reality , it s likely that trump allowed this hatred to find a foothold in his campaign due to his penchant for quickly categorizing people based on their heritage . in fact , according to the washington post , one of his employees recounted that he heard trump talk specifically about jews : i ve got black accountants at trump castle and trump plaza . black guys counting my money i hate it . the only kind of people i want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day . in 2013 , trump took a swipe at jon stewart : i promise you that i ' m much smarter than jonathan leibowitz i mean jon stewart thedailyshow . who , by the way , is totally overrated . donald j . trump ( realdonaldtrump ) april 24 , 2013 during his run for office , he addressed the republican jewish coalition s candidate forum : trump has surrounded himself with staffers and advisors very comfortable with antisemitic dog - whistles . the most glaring example of this is steven bannon . he officially joined the trump campaign in august of 2016 , and his influence was quickly felt . he quickly took aim at trump s son - in - law , jared kushner . as reported by the daily beast , bannon made it clear at the start exactly where he stood on kushner : cuckservative , a portmanteau of cuckold and conservative , has become a favorite slur on the right , used like a sexually and racially charged version of rino , a republican in name only . globalist is a term typically used by nationalist , pro - trump right - wingers against political opponents ; however , the term has also come under fire for at times carrying anti - semitic tones . ( kushner is jewish . ) bannon also used intermediaries to attack kushner on t . v . in the bombshell book fire and fury by michael wolf , bannon sheds more light on the treatment of kushner in the white house . according to vanity fair , bannon asserts that : wolff said bannon described ivanka as dumb as a brick , and says that trump placed middle east peace within kushner s broad white house portfolio because his family , longtime israel supporters , knew all the crooks in the country . as reported by newsweek , this reading of the tensions in the west wing was bolstered by testimony from henry kissinger : [ he ] described the atmosphere in the white house as a war between the jews and the non - jews . kissinger told wolff that trump and former chief strategist steve bannon were often at odds with trump s jewish family members , jared kushner and ivanka trump . wolf goes on to explain why trump would trust kushner with the monumental task of middle east peace : for trump , giving israel to kushner was not only a test , it was a jewish test , wolff wrote . the president was singling him out for being jewish , rewarding him for being jewish , saddling him with an impossible hurdle for being jewish and , too , defaulting to the stereotyping belief in the negotiating powers of jews . more details from the white house are sure to become public as more administration members begin to speak up regarding the unhealthy dynamics in trump s west wing . featured image : afp contributor / getty
one of donald trump s favorite war cries is fake news it s definitely something the american public won t forget anytime soon . with trump s constant insistence that the fake media is out to sabotage his administration , you would think he d be totally cool with educating the public on real news vs . fake news . however , business insider reported wednesday that america will not be joining several other countries in an initiative that would examine if teenagers could identify fake news or not . us education authorities decided not to include a global competence test developed by the organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) , in standardised tests used to compare education systems around the world . other countries who have refused to join in the initiative are belgium , japan , and england . so , why has america refused to join in a spokesperson at the dept . of education commented : we consider it to be an important innovation , but we want to allow it time to develop and crystalize into an operationalized assessment with a solid empirical foundation to validate its technical stability . while americans talked about technical stability , the uk s dept . of education commented its students were already taught respect and tolerance . all schools are already required to teach pupils to have a mutual respect and tolerance of those of different faiths and beliefs , so in order to not place additional burden on them , we will not be taking part in this smaller scale global competence assessment . one aspect the test would examine is the ability of teens to resist extremism . in all honesty , in a trump america , republicans and trump want people to believe extremist lies from the far - right . making sure that children are blind to the propaganda they put out is vital to keeping the public uninformed and voting for people like trump . with someone like betsy devos leading the dept . of education , it shouldn t be surprising that the government would opt out of such a test . along with not wanting to educate the children of america , they don t want to suffer the embarrassment when the test results come out that brainwashed parents have brainwashed their children into believing absolute crap . trump may stand on a stage and promise he s fighting fake news and that the fake media outlets are out to get him ; however , he s the perpetrator of fake news . he consistently tells lies regularly . earlier in january , trump made the outrageous claim that the suspect in a new york city terror attack in 2017 brought 22 to 24 people through chain migration . politifact rated that as completely false . but , trump is , of course , going to tell such a lie that has nothing to back it up . he has to have the american people believe the rhetoric to further his xenophobic agenda and further his muslim travel ban . this may not be surprising , but it is beyond disappointing . the future of america is in our children , and it s on us to teach them well . seeing where they stand on a standardized test would help america see what it needs to do to prevent the spread of misinformation . featured image by tim boyle / getty images .

in recent years , the number of hate crimes against nearly all minority races and cultures in the united states has increased dramatically , as white supremacists have emerged from the woodworks . the sheer magnitude of the racial violence against african - americans , muslims , hispanics , jewish citizens , and many minority groups has shed light on the fact that racism is still alive and abundant in america , despite the perceptions that such hateful actions were on the wane . earlier this month , 19 - year - old blaze bernstein went missing from orange county , ca while visiting his family over the holiday break . bernstein , a student at the university of pennsylvania , had been planning to meet with a former classmate of his , 20 - year - old samuel woodward . woodward is believed to have picked up bernstein from the home of his parents on january 2 nd , before driving together to a nearby park where bernstein s body would ultimately be found , buried in a shallow grave . bernstein s body had more than 20 stab wounds when found . according to a report by the los angeles times , a law enforcement source said that woodward told investigators bernstein kissed him on the lips while they were sitting in a parked car jan . 2 . the sources said woodward told authorities that the kiss was unwanted and that he pushed bernstein away , adding that he wanted to call him a faggot . authorities are now looking into the case as a potential hate crime , after finding indications of the suspect s support for white supremacist and neo - nazi ideals through his online activity . woodward had posted fundamentalist and extremist rants supporting white nationalism on fringe websites , as well as having a photo in which he had pretended to stomp a friend s skull against the curb . the photo is indicative of the infamous murder scene in the film american history x , which follows the horrific story of a neo - nazi extremist . a gay jewish man is dead because our society privileges the free speech of fascists over the safety of marginalized folks . blazebernstein < URL > megillah guerrila ( itsbensiegel ) january 23 , 2018 woodward s online activity spanned a wide range of other similarly hate - fueled beliefs , such as his support for the confederate flag , and a supposed desire to learn waterboarding . in another instance , a user on one of woodward s frequented sites and claiming to be close to the suspect stated that homophobia and anti - semitism were trademarks of his beliefs . on wednesday of this week , woodward appeared in court dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit as the judge ordered he be held without bail , until the arraignment takes place on february 2 nd . the 20 - year - old man is currently being charged for murder , with the potential of additional charges to follow . specifically so , this would include the personal use of a knife in committing the murder , which would bring his maximum sentence to a range from 26 years or life in prison , depending on the outcome of the case . the crime sheds light on the discrimination and violence faced not only by members of any minority group in the country , but most prominently the challenges faced by those in the lgbtQ community . bernstein s parents issued a statement after these potential motives were identified , stating that they will not only be shedding a tear for their own son , but also for any other lgbtQ individual that has to live with such fear from violence . featured image by getty images

isn t that the best kind of muslim student organization why do they think they are entitled to a special room let them pray in the toilet or in their dorm room . cair an over - the - hill muslim college student is upset that the university does not have a dedicated space for muslims to pray . and now , cair has filed a formal complaint with the michigan department of civil rights on behalf of this questionable muslim student who alleges the college denied him and other muslim students access to a muslim student organization . the aging student , who attends wayne county community college district , reports having applied with several other students to have a muslim student organization at the college . after submitting the application , they were told that the administration had started its own muslim organization that was being run by one of the school administrators who is not muslim . requests for the student organization to be turned over to muslim students on campus were either ignored or rejected . it is inconceivable that a religious student group would exclude the very students it was intended to benefit , said cair - mi staff attorney amy doukoure .
can we feel that there are human beings , very close to us , created in god s image , who are being buried if we cannot , perhaps we need to be silent and attentive in order to listen to their stories of suffering due to spiritual , social , economic , and / or physical conditions that are foreign to us .
in the new york times , mr . trump told maggie haberman that he willing to testify under oath to special counsel robert mueller . trump said : i m looking forward to it actually . he went on to say : here s the story , just so you understand . there s been no collusion whatsoever . there s been no obstruction whatsoever , and i m looking forward to it . trump hasn t stopped playing his usual childish games . haberman tweeted this on monday afternoon : potus , obsessed with clinton still , asked me in response to my q about under oath whether she did to the fbi . he doesn t seem to know that lying to the fbi even without being under oath is a crime . perhaps flynn can tell him . not long after haberman posted her tweet , cnn posted footage that supports haberman s claim that trump is still obsessed with clinton . in the video , trump tells reporters : you people won t say this , but i ll say it . i was a much better candidate than her . i was one of the greatest candidates . president trump brings up hillary clinton during a meeting with reporters : you people won t say this , but i ll say it . i was a much better candidate than her . i was one of the greatest candidates < URL > pic . twitter . com / l6hylhdtio cnn ( cnn ) january 24 , 2018 mr . trump is increasingly worried about hillary clinton these days and absolutely determined to make everyone believe that he s the better candidate . he is insanely concerned with whether hillary testified or not , and wants to frame all of his actions in terms of what hillary did or didn t do . according to the new york times : the president s surprise exchange with about 20 reporters served as a reminder of the extent to which mr . trump sees the russia inquiry as simply an invalidation of his electoral victory , and feels a deep sense of bitterness about the narrative surrounding his presidency . by the way though , hillary did give a voluntary testimony before fbi investigators in june 2016 regarding the email scandal , but was not under oath for this which is typical in these types of sessions . she also gave a marathon testimony before the house select committee on benghazi , and endured 11 hours of being grilled in a republican witch hunt . just from observing trump s mental stamina in recent months , this doesn t seem like something he could actually endure . according to the los angeles times : among republicans , benghazi has become a watchword on the campaign trail an almost all - purpose label for sins of both omission and commission that gOp voters perceive in the former secretary of state s record . democrats are equally convinced that the committee provides an example of republican unfairness and excess . the committee s democratic members made more than a dozen references to the panel s 4 . 7 - million price tag , saying that the gOp was wasting taxpayer money in an effort to harm clinton s campaign . w trump continues to try to deflect his mounting problems on to hillary , but it is not going to help him for long . what really matters here has nothing to do with whether or not hillary clinton ever testified about benghazi , her emails , or any other matter . what matters is what mr . trump did or didn t do in relation to russia interfering in the 2016 election , and regardless of whether he is under oath , lying to the fbi is a federal offense . as haberman mentioned , his buddy , former national security director michael flynn , knows this . this is what twitter had to say in response to maggie haberman s tweet : featured image by araya diaz / wireimage via getty images
welcome to 2018 , where the white house is occupied by a man who has publicly lied thousands upon thousands of times in the past year alone and where , concurrent to that obsessive lying , he and his allies are attempting to get federal investigators off his back no matter what the cost , even though he s supposedly completely innocent , and so has nothing to lose by not making a big show out of everything . the gop s efforts to bend the nation s justice system to their wishes don t stop with trying to discredit and end the russia investigation ; they also remain infuriated that hillary clinton was never charged with a crime for her supposedly reckless handling of classified information while secretary of state . considering this , it s no surprise that republicans have jumped on the idea that some sort of secret society to organize opposition to the president has operated at the fbi . republicans got their idea from a text message leaked from the conversations of agents lisa page and peter strzok , who have been revealed not only to have carried on with an extramarital affair but also to have harbored deep anti - trump sentiments like so many of the rest of us , of course . these anti - trump feelings were made obvious in their text conversations , having been discovered during the course of an internal bureau investigation into the handling of the clinton email investigation . at the time of the messages discovery , strzok still served on the team of special counsel for the russia investigation robert mueller , but he s been reassigned . to say that such doesn t take care of the issue to republicans satisfaction would be an understatement . the collective party s leadership is aghast that anyone in the nation s justice system could hold any personal political opinions that aren t perfectly in line with their own . on monday speaking on fox news , texas gop congressman rep . john ratcliffe relayed the supposedly incendiary information that he d become privy to , saying : we learned today about information that in the immediate aftermath of [ trump s ] election , that there may have been a secret society of folks within the department of justice and the fbi to include page and strzok that would be working against him . i m not saying that actually happened , but when folks speak in those terms , they need to come forward to explain the context with which they used those terms . check out some of ratcliffe s comments about the matter offered this week on fox below . according to numerous sources with at least one outlet having the apparent actual text it s not at all indicated that there was an actual secret society at work in the fbi in clinton s favor and against trump at any time before or after the 2016 presidential election . the text , apparently sent from page to strzok the day after trump s surprise election victory , reads : are you even going to give out your calendars seems kind of depressing . maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society . would someone who actually had a secret society speak of it in such a way come on , now , republicans , this is getting nutty even for you guys . on tuesday , wisconsin gop senator ron johnson made the wild claim that he had an informant telling him information about secret off - site meetings involving members of the fbi and the gop before saying wait maybe not the next day . on wednesday , johnson said : all i said when i read that , it didn t surprise me , because , you know , we are the committee that whistle - blowers come to to talk about all kinds of problems throughout the federal government i , you know , i have heard , you know , from somebody who has talked to our committee , that there there is a group of individuals in the fbi that was holding secret , off - site meetings . the fbi no doubt holds numerous secret , off - site meetings on a regular basis . in short , the furor over this supposed secret society is likely to go the way of the numerous other gop conspiracy theories , all while special counsel mueller continues his investigation whether the gop likes it or not . he may soon interview none other than president trump himself . featured image via mark wilson / getty images
this is the surface of a giant star , 350 times larger than the sun headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next when it comes to looking beyond our solar system , astronomers are often forced to theorize about what they don t know based on what they do . in short , they have to rely on what we have learned studying the sun and the planets from our own solar system in order to make educated guesses about how other star systems and their respective bodies formed and evolved . for example , astronomers have learned much from our sun about how convection plays a major role in the life of stars . until now , they have not been able to conduct detailed studies of the surfaces of other stars because of their distances and obscuring factors . however , in a historic first , an international team of scientists recently created the first detailed images of the surface of a red giant star located roughly 530 light - years away . the study recently appeared in the scientific journal nature under the title large granulation cells on the surface of the giant star gruis . the study was led by claudia paladini of the universit libre de bruxelles and included members from the european southern observatory , the universit de nice sophia - antipolis , georgia state university , the universit grenoble alpes , uppsala university , the university of vienna , and the university of exeter . the surface of the red giant star 1 gruis from pionier on the vlt . credit : eso for the sake of their study , the team used the precision integrated - optics near - infrared imaging experiment ( pionier ) instrument on the eso s very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) to observe the star known as gruis . located 530 light - years from earth in the constellation of grus ( the crane ) , 1 gruis is a cool red giant . while it is the same mass as our sun , it is 350 times larger and several thousand times as bright . for decades , astronomers have sought to learn more about the convection properties and evolution of stars by studying red giants . these are what become of main sequence stars once they have exhausted their hydrogen fuel and expand to becomes hundreds of times their normal diameter . unfortunately , studying the convection properties of most supergiant stars has been challenging because their surfaces are frequently obscured by dust . after obtaining interferometric data on 1 gruis in september of 2014 , the team then relied on image reconstruction software and algorithms to compose images of the star s surface . these allowed the team to determine the convection patterns of the star by picking out its granules , the large grainy spots on the surface that indicate the top of a convective cell . this was the first time that such images have been created , and represent a major breakthrough when it comes to our understanding of how stars age and evolve . as dr . fabien baron , an assistant professor at georgia state university and a co - author on the study , explained : this is the first time that we have such a giant star that is unambiguously imaged with that level of details . the reason is there s a limit to the details we can see based on the size of the telescope used for the observations . for this paper , we used an interferometer . the light from several telescopes is combined to overcome the limit of each telescope , thus achieving a resolution equivalent to that of a much larger telescope . artist s impression of the earth scorched by our sun as it enters its red giant branch phase . credit : wikimedia commons / fsgregs this study is especially significant because 1 gruis in the last major phase of life and resembles what our sun will look like when it is at the end of its lifespan . in other words , when our sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel in roughly five billion years , it will expand significantly to become a red giant star . at this point , it will be large enough to encompass mercury , venus , and maybe even earth . as a result , studying this star will give scientists insight into the future activity , characteristics and appearance of our sun . for instance , our sun has about two million convective cells that typically measure 2 , 000 km ( 1243 mi ) in diameter . based on their study , the team estimates that the surface of 1 gruis has a complex convective pattern , with granules measuring about 1 . 2 x 10 8 km ( 62 , 137 , 119 mi ) horizontally or 27 percent of the diameter of the star . this is consistent with what astronomers have predicted , which was that giant and supergiant stars should only have a few large convective cells because of their low surface gravity . as baron indicated : these images are important because the size and number of granules on the surface actually fit very well with models that predict what we should be seeing . that tells us that our models of stars are not far from reality . we re probably on the right track to understand these kinds of stars . an illustration of the structure of the sun and a red giant star , showing their convective zones . these are the granular zones in the outer layers of the stars . credit : eso the detailed map also indicated differences in surface temperature , which were apparent from the different colors on the star s surface . this are also consistent with what we know about stars , where temperature variations are indicative of processes that are taking place inside . as temperatures rise and fall , the hotter , more fluid areas become brighter ( appearing white ) while the cooler , denser areas become darker ( red ) . looking ahead , paladini and her team want to create even more detailed images of the surface of giant stars . the main aim of this is to be able to follow the evolution of these granules continuously , rather than merely getting snapshots of different points in time . from these and similar studies , we are not only likely to learn more about the formation and evolution of different types of stars in our universe ; we re also sure to get a better understanding of what our solar system is in for . further reading : georgia state university , eso , nature the post this is the surface of a giant star , 350 times larger than the sun appeared first on universe today . source : < URL >
haitian detainees are captive capital for private prison corporation when they cannot make more money out of us , then they deport us quickly . my first trip to the geo group s adelanto detention center , the privately - run prison facility located deep inland in southern california s san bernardino county , was to meet with a haitian asylum seeker , mr . clement . [ 1 ] mr . clement had entered the u . s . from mexico and had been in detention for nine months . earlier that summer , he participated in a hunger strike that brought together central american and haitian asylum seekers demanding better treatment in adelanto . it was through this strike that he and some of the other detained haitian men had garnered some attention . and through a series of legal and activist connections connections stretching from local immigration rights organizers through florida , haiti , and back to los angeles i heard of mr . clement and faced , for the first time , the travesty of detention for haitian immigrants and asylum seekers in southern california . haitian immigrants and asylum seekers are a growing population within detention centers all over the u . s . southwest . numbers vary , but there are estimates of thousands of noncriminal haitians incarcerated , with the largest population in otay mesa , arizona . haitian migration to these parts is relatively new , beginning with a trickle arriving early 2016 to thousands today . ( mr . clement said that there were about thirty to fifty other haitian men , as well as a small number of africans , detained in his jail block . he was not sure of the numbers held in other blocks , or of how many haitian women are being held in the women s wing of adelanto . ) this migration is also unusual . it reflects a new pattern for haitian migrants , who originally traveled the direct route over the caribbean sea to the eastern u . s . , and settled in metropolitan centers such as miami and new york , cities with large caribbean and african immigrant populations . this new pattern of migration means a more than 7 , 000 - mile trek over land from brazil through south and central america , into mexico and , finally , crossing one of the borders into the u . s . southwest . this migration reflects a new pattern for haitian migrants . mr . clement s journey to the u . s . was not an easy one . but his story is similar to that of other haitian migrants in southern california . he left haiti for the dominican republic and later traveled to brazil . he was in brazil for eight months , working odd jobs , barely surviving . life in brazil was precarious for mr . clement as it was for other haitian men and women . brazil , already known for its long history of anti - black racism , was almost unbearable for haitians , who are perceived as too black , and often suffered racist violence . [ 2 ] many haitians have decided to leave brazil , risking their lives to make the treacherous trek to the united states where they have family . similarly , from brazil , mr . clement traveled by land through peru , ecuador , columbia , panama , costa rica , nicaragua , honduras , guatemala , and mexico . the journey took more than three months , interrupted by arrests ( for example , nicaraguan officials arrested haitians on site and jailed them for days ) and a lack of funds . occasionally , haitian migrants would claim to be from an african country in order not to be harassed by officials in some central american states . mr . clement spoke of the difficulty of the journey through central america including having friends and fellow travelers die in the columbian forests , drowning as they crossed rivers , or being robbed by local bandits . he said honduras [ 3 ] provided something of a reprieve a small community in choluteca became one of the first groups to treat the haitian travelers as family . tijuana was the only other place in his travels where mr . clement felt he was treated with kindness . brazil was almost unbearable for haitians , who are perceived as too black , he said honduras provided something of a reprieve a small community in choluteca became one of the first groups to treat the haitian travelers as family . tijuana was the only other place in his travels where mr . clement felt he was treated with kindness . mr . clement spent more than a month in tijuana , waiting for an appointment date from the mexican government to cross the border into the u . s . [ 4 ] when mr . clement finally approached the san ysidro border crossing he was immediately arrested . he was surprised to find that his initial immigration interview was conducted by a haitian - american border patrol officer in haitian creole ( krey l ayisyen ) . the officer was intimidating , mr . clement said . he repeatedly accused mr . clement of being a haitian gang member who was running away from rivals , a claim mr . clement denied . after mr . clement was processed he was sent to a small holding cell . the cell was not meant for more than three or four people but was packed with at least thirty individuals . the holding cell had no window or bed . most people slept sitting up while some slept on mats . the prisoners could not shower or brush their teeth . they didn t know how long migrants were held there , but mr . clement believed that it was around five days . ( other haitian migrants confirmed these facts . ) after those five days , they were moved to actual jail cells in another prison in san diego ( whose name he and the others do not know ) . after three days there , the migrants and asylum seekers were put in prison jumpsuits , shackled with chains at the waist , wrists , and ankles , and placed on a bus for the more than six - hour drive to the adelanto detention center . mr . clement and his colleagues discussed their treatment in the u . s . from border guards to prison guards as condescending and inhumane and they all stated that they were not expecting to be treated like criminals the moment they crossed the border . they described the humiliation of not being able to use the toilet on the long bus trip to adelanto . some people urinated on themselves while others asked their fellow prisoners to unzip their pants to remove their penises so they could urinate where they sat . the lights in the cells were never turned off and the detention center was always freezing cold . the men described their months - long stay at adelanto as torture . the men recounted being kept indoors most of the time , and allowed outdoors once a week but only for a very short period . they were not allowed to sleep more than a few hours at a time . for example , when guards ordered the inmates into their small rooms at 11 p . m . , they had to wake up at 1 a . m . for a head count . after ordering everyone back to their rooms , the guards woke them up again at 4 or 5 a . m . for breakfast . the lights in the cells were never turned off which , according to one former haitian detainee , affected those on the top bunks even more and the detention center was always freezing cold . in addition , some of the haitians complained of guards using racial slurs against them , calling them fucking blacks and haitian trash . at adelanto , haitians have had larger bond amounts ( ranging anywhere from 15 , 000 to 50 , 000 ) placed on them to secure their release than immigrant prisoners elsewhere in the u . s . and until recently , very few haitians have been able to bond out of adelanto and few have won their asylum cases . a colleague who currently conducts research at adelanto suggested that the denial rate for haitian asylum cases there was almost 100 . at the same time , despite the denial rates , the asylum seekers are forced to serve extended periods in detention before their deportation . mr . clement spoke of adelanto as sucking us dry . i know that this prison is private business , and that this body [ he gestures to his chest ] is worth 140 per day for adelanto . so they hold us for as long as they can . they give us high bonds that we cannot pay . they change our asylum hearing dates . they even force those who do not want asylum to claim asylum so they can keep them longer . when they cannot make more money out of us , then they deport us quickly . some of the haitians complained of guards calling them fucking blacks and haitian trash . indeed , reporter kate morrissey argued that as of november 2016 , detaining haitians in immigration holding facilities is costing american taxpayers an estimated 379 , 380 per day . [ 5 ] that number is greater now . mr . clement and some of his friends describe a number of african immigrants and asylum seekers who , having been detained for months without hope , attempted suicide . compared to those coming from central america and mexico , the detention of haitian migrants and asylum seekers in the u . s . southwest is relatively recent . [ 6 ] when haitian migrants first began in appear at the u . s . - mexico border in small groups in early 2016 , [ 7 ] they were allowed into the u . s . through what is called a humanitarian parole , given a three - year temporary pass and released to family members . however , by late september 2016 , and as the numbers of immigrants and asylum seekers increased exponentially , the obama administration s department of homeland security put new arrivals in expedited removal proceedings , which means that they could be and were detained in prisons , especially if they have asylum claims . how did so many haitian people end up at the u . s . - mexico border and , ultimately , at the adelanto detention center and other facilities throughout the u . s . southwest in the increasing coverage given to this recent wave of haitian migrants , the story seems simple : haitians traveled to brazil under humanitarian visas after the 2010 earthquake , and later were recruited to brazil as a cheap labor source while the country prepared to host the 2014 world cup and the 2016 summer olympics . since then , brazil has been beset by severe economic retrenchment , forcing many haitians to leave for the u . s . yet there is much more to this . migrants leave haiti for economic reasons , but also because of gang - related persecution , political instability , domestic abuse , and extreme homophobia . [ 8 ] the country has also suffered from a long history of foreign military interventions , including ten interventions by the u . s . since the end of the nineteenth century . the u . s . also occupied haiti twice in the twentieth century , the longest being the nineteen - year military occupation from 1915 - 1934 . most recently , haiti has been under a militarized foreign occupation since february 2004 , when the u . s . , canada , and france sponsored a coup d tat to oust its popularly elected president , jean bertrand aristide . [ 9 ] the coup d tat led to a short military occupation by u . s . forces , which was later sanctioned by the united nations security council when they approved a peacekeeping mission in haiti . [ 10 ] the military wing of the mission was headed by brazil for more than a decade . [ 11 ] the occupation of haiti has also added to the country s political instability , undermining haitian democracy and self - determination and challenging sovereignty . it has also led to massive suffering : fall 2010 , not long after the earthquake january of that year that killed hundreds of thousands of people , nepalese troops brought cholera to haiti . it induced an epidemic that has sickened more than a million haitians and killed between 10 , 000 and 30 , 000 . [ 12 ] accountability has not been forthcoming . the un has refused to admit its culpability and the haitian people have had no avenue for redress . haiti has been under a militarized foreign occupation since february 2004 , when the u . s . , canada , and france sponsored a coup d tat . when we met , mr . clement was preparing to present his asylum claim before a u . s . immigration court housed not far from the ice offices within the adelanto facility . immigration proceedings in detention centers are considered administrative matters and are less formal than regular court proceedings . the usual rules of evidence do not apply and the presiding judges have substantial leeway in their interpretation of testimony and the assessment of asylum claims . meanwhile , as u . s . immigration policy dictates , he can only receive legal representation at his own expense ; mr . clement was forced to represent himself . yet despite such terrible circumstances , mr . clement is one of the fortunate ones . with the help of a bond fund [ 13 ] established for the adelanto hunger strikers by a local organization , volunteers were able to bond him out of the detention center just before his deportation hearing . a regular immigration judge on the outside rather than within adelanto will now hear his asylum case , and mr . clement will now have a more normal set of legal set of proceedings . at the same time , he is stuck within the u . s . criminal justice system . he was bonded out on a 17 , 000 bond with two ankle bracelets ( shackles produced by a subsidiary of the geo group ) one for ice , and one for the bond company . the bond company that collateralized his release requires former detainees to pay a 480 activation fee for the ankle monitor , and 420 per month service fee for as long as it takes for his case to be resolved . yet , as an asylum seeker awaiting trial , mr . clement is not allowed to seek employment to cover this non - refundable fee , the ankle monitor fee , or his day - to - day living expenses . mr . clement may be out of detention , but he is certainly not free . this article previously appeared in boom california . notes with gratitude to peter james hudson for his brilliant and generous feedback .

washington two former staff employees of a member of the u . s . house of representatives pled guilty today to charges stemming from the circulation of private , nude images and videos of the member and the member s spouse . juan r . mccullum , 36 , of washington , d . c . , and dorene browne - louis , 45 , of upper marlboro , md . , entered the guilty pleas in the u . s . district court for the district of columbia . mccullum pled guilty to two federal cyber - related charges and two district of columbia offenses , including conspiracy to disclose sexual images and attempted first - degree unlawful publication of a sexual image . browne - louis pled guilty to one federal cyber charge and the district of columbia offense of conspiracy to disclose sexual images . the honorable john d . bates scheduled mccullum s sentencing for march 8 , 2018 and scheduled browne - louis s sentencing for april 23 , 2018 . each of the federal charges carries a statutory maximum of a year in prison and each district of columbia offense carries up to 180 days in jail . mccullum s plea , which is contingent upon the court s approval , calls for an agreed - upon sentence of one year and 361 days of incarceration , with all but one year and a day suspended on the condition that he successfully completes two years of supervised probation . during his probation , mccullum would be required to perform 100 hours of community service . both defendants were indicted in july 2017 following an investigation by the united states capitol police . according to statements of offense filed as part of the guilty plea , mccullum worked from april 2015 until june 2016 in the del . stacey plaskett s legislative office in washington , d . c . browne - louis worked in the same office from january 2015 until april 2016 . according to the documents , during the course of his employment , mccullum offered in march 2016 to assist the house member in repairing the member s malfunctioning , password - protected iphone by taking the device to a local apple store . the house member provided mccullum with the device solely to have it repaired . the house member later provided the password so that the device could be unlocked by the apple store solely for the purpose of having the iphone repaired . mccullum was not given permission to take , copy , or distribute any of the contents of the iphone . the iphone contained the private , nude images and videos . in july 2016 , the documents state , after mccullum left the house member s staff , he engaged in a course of conduct that included creating a hotmail account and a facebook social media account , using a fictitious name , to distribute and post the private , nude images and videos . in addition , he made browne - louis aware that he was in possession of the images from the iphone . further , mccullum encouraged others on social media to redistribute the private , nude images and videos in the member s congressional district . browne - louis assisted by providing mccullum with e - mail addresses and other contact information to distribute the images . browne - louis also distributed one of the private , nude images to a person who was working on the campaign of a challenger to the member s primary election . mccullum and browne - louis understood their actions did cause , and were likely to cause , emotional harm to the house member and spouse , as well as the member s re - election , the plea documents state .
los angeles a former assistant track coach pleaded no contest yesterday to having sexual relations with three teenage girls over a four - month period . at monday s court appearance , johnny arellano 26 , of norwalk pleaded no contest to three felony counts : one count of oral copulation of a person under 16 and two counts of oral copulation of a person under 18 . the defendant is scheduled to be sentenced feb . 21 in department j of the los angeles county superior court , norwalk branch . arellano is expected to be sentenced to three years in state prison and ordered to register as a lifetime sex offender . deputy district attorney michael derose of the victim impact program , who prosecuted the case , said arellano was the former assistant track coach at norwalk high school . between june and october 2017 , the defendant engaged in sexual acts with two female students , the prosecutor said . a concerned adult alerted authorities and the defendant was taken into custody on oct . 5 , 2017 , the prosecutor added . after further investigation , law enforcement learned of a third teenage girl who was involved in a sexual relationship with arellano between august and september 2017 , according to the prosecutor .
baltimore david thornton was found guilty by a baltimore city jury of voluntary manslaughter and use of a deadly weapon with the intent to injure in the homicide of 17 - year - old jawan henry . at the time , thornton was on parole from a second degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder conviction . assistant state s attorney ( asa ) bethany durand prosecuted the case . on march 8 , 2014 , baltimore police were called to the 2600 block of mura street for a stabbing . upon arrival , officers found the victim located in the block with a single stab wound to the abdomen . he was transported to johns hopkins hospital where he died . an autopsy determined the cause of death was the stab wound which had severed his aorta . witnesses were located who identified david thornton as the person who had stabbed henry with a knife after an argument over 10 that thornton s girlfriend owed the victim for doing household chores for her . asa durand obtained a conviction for thornton s crimes in september 2015 , but the maryland court of special appeals determined that thornton was entitled to a new trial because the jury had not been given a self - defense instruction from the judge before deliberations . our prosecutors are not deterred by cases being sent back on appeal , and i d like the victims of crime in baltimore to know that we will remain relentless in our pursuit of justice , said state s attorney mosby . i hope the outcome of this case provides solace to the family of this young man after this nearly four year journey to justice . thornton was sentenced to the maximum penalty of 13 years in prison for his crimes .
knoxville an investigation by special agents with the tennessee bureau of investigation has led to the indictment of a morristown woman accused of falsely reporting a sexual assault incident . in april 2017 , at the request of 4 th district attorney general james dunn , tbi special agents began investigating allegations of sexual assault involving three sevierville police officers . ashley nicole green reported that she was sexually assaulted by the officers while she was unconscious . the investigation revealed that the incident did not occur . on january 5 th , the sevier county grand jury returned an indictment charging green with one count of false reporting . today , green was arrested and booked into the sevier county jail on a 7 , 500 bond .
abdirahman sheik mohamud , 26 , of columbus , ohio , was sentenced on jan . 22 , to 22 years in prison to be followed by 10 years of supervised release , for training with terrorists overseas and leading a terrorist plot . mohamud traveled to syria to train and fight with the designated terrorist organization al - nusrah front . he then returned to the united states with the intent to conduct an attack here , said acting assistant attorney general boente . thanks to the tremendous efforts of law enforcement , mohamud was arrested and his plans were thwarted . one of the national security division s highest priorities remains identifying and neutralizing the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters who return to the united states . mohamud engaged in terrorist activity overseas , which included training and fighting with the al - nusrah front , a designated foreign terrorist organization , said u . s . attorney glassman . he then returned to the united states with a plan to do grievous harm , recruited others to help him in his homeland plot , and then planned and prepared for attacks in the united states . once caught , he orchestrated a cover - up beginning with his material misstatements to the fbi . the seriousness of his actions cannot be overstated and today s sentence illustrates that . mohamud was originally arrested and indicted in state court by my office and a 2 million bond was set that maintained him in custody . those state charges were dismissed when the federal prosecution commenced and assistant prosecutor joseph gibson was added to the federal team as a special assistant u . s . attorney , said franklin county prosecutor o brien . this case illustrates the effectiveness of the cooperative effort in the columbus area to combat terrorism . a federal grand jury charged mohamud in april 2015 with one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists , one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization namely , al - nusrah front and one count of making false statements to the fbi involving international terrorism . mohamud pleaded guilty to those charges in august 2015 . the plea was sealed until june 2017 because of an ongoing investigation . according to court documents , mohamud is a somali - born naturalized u . s . citizen , who , in 2014 , obtained a u . s . passport and one - way ticket to greece . during his travel in april 2014 , mohamud did not board his connecting flight to athens , greece . rather , during his layover in istanbul , turkey , he completed pre - arranged plans to cross the border into syria . in syria , mohamud received training from al - nusrah front , a terrorist organization affiliated with al - qaeda . according to a statement of facts supporting mohamud s guilty plea , while in syria , mohamud trained with al - nusrah front on fitness , and on the use of weapons and tactics . mohamud also engaged in a firefight and expressed his desire to die fighting in syria . mohamud returned to the united states after his brother was killed fighting for al - nusrah front . the statement of facts details that after returning to the united states , mohamud planned to obtain weapons in order to kill military officers , other government employees or people in uniform . evidence seized by the fbi indicates that mohamud researched places in the u . s . to carry out such plans .

in the mysterious case of exoplanet corot - 2 b , however , the hot spot turns out to lie in the opposite direction : west of center . a research team led by astronomers at mcgill university s mcgill space institute ( msi ) and the institute for research on exoplanets ( irex ) in montreal made the discovery using nasa s spitzer space telescope . their findings are reported jan . 22 in the journal nature astronomy . wrong - way wind we ve previously studied nine other hot jupiter , giant planets orbiting super close to their star . in every case , they have had winds blowing to the east , as theory would predict , says mcgill astronomer nicolas cowan , a co - author on the study and researcher at msi and irex . but now , nature has thrown us a curveball . on this planet , the wind blows the wrong way . since it s often the exceptions that prove the rule , we are hoping that studying this planet will help us understand what makes hot jupiters tick . corot - 2 b , discovered a decade ago by a french - led space observatory mission , is 930 light years from earth . while many other hot jupiters have been detected in recent years , corot - 2 b has continued to intrigue astronomers because of two factors : its inflated size and the puzzling spectrum of light emissions from its surface . both of these factors suggest there is something unusual happening in the atmosphere of this hot jupiter , says lisa dang , a mcgill phd student and lead author of the new study . by using spitzer s infrared array camera to observe the planet while it completed an orbit around its host star , the researchers were able to map the planet s surface brightness for the first time , revealing the westward hot spot . new questions the researchers offer three possible explanations for the unexpected discovery each of which raises new questions : the planet could be spinning so slowly that one rotation takes longer than a full orbit of its star ; this could create winds blowing toward the west rather than the east but it would also undercut theories about planet - star gravitational interaction in such tight orbits . the planet s atmosphere could be interacting with the planet s magnetic field to modify its wind pattern ; this could provide a rare opportunity to study an exoplanet s magnetic field . large clouds covering the eastern side of the planet could make it appear darker than it would otherwise but this would undercut current models of atmospheric circulation on such planets . we ll need better data to shed light on the questions raised by our finding , dang says . fortunately , the james webb space telescope , scheduled to launch next year , should be capable of tackling this problem . armed with a mirror that has 100 times the collecting power of spitzer s , it should provide us with exquisite data like never before . scientists from the university of michigan , the california institute of technology , arizona state university , new york university abu dhabi , the university of california , santa cruz , and pennsylvania state university also contributed to the study .
upcoming telescopes should be able to detect mountains and other landscapes on extrasolar planets headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next the study of exoplanets has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past few decades . between ground - based observatories and spacecraft like the kepler mission , a total of 3 , 726 exoplanets have been confirmed in 2 , 792 systems , with 622 systems having more than one planet ( as of jan . 1 st , 2018 ) . and in the coming years , scientists expect that many more discoveries will be possible thanks to the deployment of next - generation missions . these include nasa s james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and several next - generation ground based observatories . with their advanced instruments , these and other observatories are not only expected to find many more exoplanets , but to reveal new and fascinating things about them . for instance , a recent study from columbia university indicated that it will be possible , using the transit method , to study surface elevations on exoplanets . the study , which recently appeared online under the title finding mountains with molehills : the detectability of exotopography , was conducted by moiya mctier and david kipping and graduate student and an assistant professor of astronomy at columbia university , respectively . based on models they created using bodies in our solar system , the team considered whether transit surveys might be able to reveal topographical data on exoplanets . artist s impression of an extra - solar planet transiting its star . credit : Qub astrophysics research center to recap , the transit method ( aka . transit photometry ) is currently the most popular and reliable means for detecting exoplanets . it consists of astronomers measuring the light curve of distant stars over time and looking for periodic dips in brightness . these dips are the result of exoplanets passing in front of the star ( i . e . transiting ) relative to the observer . by measuring the rate at which the star s light dips , and the period with which the dimming occurs , astronomer are not only able to determine the presence of exoplanets , but also place accurate constraints on their size and orbital periods . according to mctier and kipping , this same method could also reveal the presence of geographical features for instance , mountain ranges , volcanoes , trenches , and craters . as they indicate in their study , in lieu of direct imaging , indirect methods are the only means astronomers have for revealing data on an exoplanet s surface . unfortunately , there is no conceivable way that the radial velocity , microlensing , astrometry , and timing methods could reveal exotopography . this leaves the transit method , which has some potential in this respect . as they state : the transit method directly measures the sky - projected area of a planet s silhouette relative to that of a star , under the assumption that the planet is not luminous itself this fact implies that there is indeed some potential for transits to reveal surface features , since the planet s silhouette is certainly distorted from a circular profile due to the presence of topography . satellite image of the himalayan mountain chain , as imaged by nasa slandsat - 7 imagery of himalayas . credit : nasa in other words , as a planet transits in front of its host star , the light passing around the planet itself could be measured for small variations . these could indicate the presence of mountain ranges and other large - scale features like massive chasms . to test this theory , they considered planets in the solar system as templates for how the scattering of light during a transit could reveal large - scale features . as an example , they consider what an earth analog planet would reveal if the himalayan mountain range ran from north to south and was wide enough to span 1 in longitude : now assume that the planet completes half of one rotation as it transits its parent star from our point of view , which is all that is necessary to see all of the planet s features appear on its silhouette without repeating . as our hypothetical planet rotates and the himalayan block moves into and out of view , the change in silhouette will result in different transit depths ultimately , they consider that mars would be the ideal test case due to its combination of small size , low surface gravity , and active internal volcanism , which has caused it become what they describe as the bumpiest body in the solar system . when paired with a white dwarf star , this presents the optimal case for using light curves to determine exotopography . color mosaic of mars greatest mountain , olympus mons , viewed from orbit . credit nasa / jpl at a distance of about 0 . 01 au ( which would be within a white dwarf s habitable zone ) , they calculate that a mars - sized planet would have an orbital period of 11 . 3 hours . this would allow for many transits to be observed in a relatively short viewing period , thus ensuring a greater degree of accuracy . at the same time , the team admits that their proposed methods suffers from drawbacks . for instance , due to the presence of astrophysical and instrumental noise , they determined that their method would be unproductive when it comes to studying exoplanets around sun - like stars and m - type ( red dwarf ) stars . but for mars - like planets orbiting low mass , white dwarf stars , the method could produce some highly valuable scientific returns . while this might sound rather limited , it would present some rather fascinating opportunities to learn more about planets beyond our solar system . as they explain : finding the first evidence of mountains on planets outside our solar system would be exciting in its own right , but we can also infer planet characteristics from the presence and distribution of surface features . for example , a detection of bumpiness could lead to constraints on a planet s internal processes . in short , planets with a high degree of bumpiness would indicate tectonic activity or the buildup of lava caused by internal heating sources . those with the highest bumpiness ( i . e . like mars ) would indicate that they too experience a combination internal processes , low surface gravity , volcanism , and a lack of tectonic plate movement . meanwhile , low - bumpiness planets are less likely to have any of these internal processes and their surfaces are more likely to be shaped by external factors like asteroid bombardment . artist s impression of the owl telescope being deployed at night from its enclosure , where it will operated during the daytime . credit : eso based on their estimates , they conclude that the various super telescopes that are scheduled to be commissioned in the coming years would be up to task . these include the eso s overwhelmingly large ( owl ) telescope , a 100 - meter proposed optical and near - infrared telescope that would build on the success of the very large telescope ( vlt ) and the upcoming extremely large telescope ( elt ) . another example is the colossus telescope , a 74 - meter optical and infrared telescope that is currently being commissioned by an international consortium . once operational , it will be the largest telescope optimized for detecting extrasolar life and extraterrestrial civilizations . in the past , the success of exoplanet hunters has come down to a combination of factors . in addition to greater levels of cooperation between institutions , amateur astronomers and citizen scientists , there has also been the way in which improved technology has coincided with new theoretical models . as more data become available , scientists are able to produce more educated estimates on what we might be able to learn once new instruments come online . when the next - generation telescopes take to space or are finished construction here on earth , we can anticipate that thousands more exoplanets will be found . at the same time , we can anticipate that important details will be also discovered about these planets that were not possible before . do they have atmospheres do they have oceans do they have mountain ranges and chasms we hope to find out further reading : arxiv the post upcoming telescopes should be able to detect mountains and other landscapes on extrasolar planets appeared first on universe today . source : < URL >
obama s the greatest criminal in history say trump and joe arpaio because he forged his birth certificate ( video )
beyond imagination : uranium one headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next beyond imagination : uranium one by anne williamson the multilayered story surrounding uranium one the former south african , then canadian , and now russian company , of which both bill and hillary clinton and their family foundation are the enriched beneficiaries has all the usual elements of a typical clinton scandal . a talented con man , bill clinton perfected his game in arkansas . through his control over state contracts , regulatory agencies , and judicial appointments , the creation of public credit and of agencies like the arkansas development and finance authority and their misuse , then - governor clinton was able to reward his allies , punish his enemies , and insert his political machine into nearly every endeavor , public and private , statewide . clinton nailed down the couple s franchise by continually getting himself re - elected governor of arkansas , while his spouse handled the paperwork at the rose law firm . when bill and hillary made the move from little rock to washington , the territory under their influence was enlarged , and the public cash pots at their disposal grew significantly , but their modus operandi remained the same . the only thing that changed when hillary began her adventures in the u . s . senate , and then at the state department , was that she was now the one with political power , and bill became the ornamental figure . uranium one s predecessor is a canadian company , urasia energy ltd . , founded in 2005 by canadian mining financier frank giustra . by mysterious means giustra was able to fill what was no more than a shell company with the rights to three uranium mines located in kazakhstan , a former soviet republic that is fantastically rich in just about everything , including uranium . bill clinton appears to have played a significant role in smoothing the rough edges of giustra s good fortune by supporting kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev s appointment to a u . n . agency dedicated to validating elections , a p . r . coup for nazarbayev . thereafter , bill got the use of giustra s luxurious private jet , and the two began jetting about the globe together to third world countries that enjoy attractive endowments of natural resources . bill made his speeches , and frank made his deals . in 2007 , urasia purchased a south african uranium firm , uranium one , and moved the company to canada while retaining the firm s south african name . bill and frank then set up their own philanthropic entity , the clinton giustra sustainable growth initiative , to promote progressive environmental and labor practices in the natural resources industry . giustra pledged 100 million and dragged in 16 million more in pledges at a 2008 star - studded gala in toronto . in 2008 , things got more interesting . the russian atomic - energy agency rosatom , short of uranium for its own needs , entered into negotiations for a 17 - percent stake in uranium one . but in 2009 , kazakhstan questioned uranium one s claim of having obtained government approvals for urasia s first mine purchases . the kazakh government s public doubts coincided with the arrest of mukhtar dzhakishev , the head of kazatomprom ( the country s national importer and exporter of nuclear - fuel components ) , on charges of illegally selling uranium deposits to foreign companies . uranium one s shareholders and principals were beside themselves . would the company lose the kazakh mines already , uranium one s stock value had collapsed by 40 percent . the moscow investment bank renaissance capital was similarly alarmed since it had been heavily promoting uranium one shares to its investors . could some dastardly russian scheme for control of kazakh uranium assets be afoot and was it possible that vladimir putin , who enjoys excellent relations with his kazakh neighbor , and with president nazarbayev personally , was the kingpin of the operation now why would anyone think that the office of the presidency of the russian federation is relatively new , having come into existence a mere quarter century ago . vladimir putin s interpretation of the office is shaping and defining it . he is the nation s khozyain , a unique figure whose origins are in russia s misty past when the slavic tribes roaming the great eurasian steppe were among the freest people on earth . unlike western europe , the tribal lord wasn t an hereditary office , but one elected by the veche ( popular assembly ) in which each mature male householder of the votchina ( estate ) had a vote . when one khozyain s leadership delivered poor results , the votchina s electorate did not hesitate to replace him . and since each householder considered himself a rightful claimant to some part of the votchina s earnings , the criterion for political support was the shared prosperity and security of all claimants . vladimir putin s principal aim has been the restoration of the russian state and economy , and for that the state must be protected from both invaders and usurpers . this requires an army , which , in turn , requires the state to have income preferably income that is not derived from crushing both healthy competition and the population generally , as was true under the tsars and the commissars . thus we arrive at the 1999 law on state corporations that governs strategic industries and giants like russian railways , sberbank , rosneft , and rosatom . each corporation is created by separate legislation and escapes the scrutiny of the federal agency for state property management , being controlled instead by the kremlin . in the first years of putin s rule , kremlin strategists puzzled over the best ways in which to invigorate the russian economy . where might they excel in this new , modern world in which post - soviet russia was struggling to find her footing what was russia good at what could russia provide the world besides oil and gas the answer was bigness . enormity does give the russians a special joy . the idea of bigness empowers them : the biggest country , the biggest dam , the biggest steel mill . when describing some aspect of their industries or their land to a visitor in terms of big , they will sigh in exasperation because the guest clearly doesn t grasp just how big big is . the poet lermontov captured the russians proud defiance when he wrote , we may be slaves , but we are enslaved by russia , the ruler of the universe . rosatom , a large state corporation built in 2007 out of the soviet atomic industry s degraded assets , exemplifies the russian state s policy of developing key strategic industries and infrastructure . these big state corporations are ( at least in theory ) positioned to enable and stimulate the rest of the economy ; in turn , rosatom s ( and similar firms ) corporate earnings support the state . rosatom s projects are enormous , and the russians have proved themselves quite adept at developing nuclear reactor technology as well as advanced safety technology and procedures . they are also quite capable of strengthening the country s position in the global nuclear - energy market . the kremlin s idea of delivering nuclear - industry products to customers that cover the entire supply chain from raw uranium to a reactor s final energy output is being realized , and uranium one is a part of that story . it s a story that began in vancouver at the first clinton - yeltsin summit . in april 1993 , americans were rightly concerned about nuclear proliferation , but wrongly focused on a contract moscow had with iran to build a nuclear reactor . in his memoir the russia hand , strobe talbott , bill clinton s advisor on russian affairs , insisted that this reactor , once completed , would contribute to the covert nuclear - weapons program of a regime that supported international terrorism and violently opposed the middle east peace process . the russians knew the iranians had no covert nuclear - weapons program , and that peace in the middle east hinged more on israel s behavior than on iran s . viktor mikhailov , then - minister of atomic energy , refused to swallow what he said was washington s cover story to conceal its true aim : keeping russia out of a legitimate market for nuclear technology . russia needed income , and what russia sold and to whom was none of washington s business . that was hardly what the americans expected to hear . talbott quotes his then - assistant and future state department ukrainian strategist and outspoken e . u . supporter toria nuland : see that s how the russians are . you try to get them to eat their spinach , and the more you tell them it s good for them , the more they gag . after the first chechen war erupted in 1994 , the iranian contract took on additional importance . russia is home to the largest population of muslims of any predominantly christian country on earth . concentrated in the caucasus ( chechnya , ingushetia , dagestan , circassia , bashkiria , etc . ) , islam s centuries - old settlements and communities crawl northward along both sides of the volga to tatarstan , and westerly to bashkortostan . having already lost the buffer of eastern europe and nearly a third of the soviet union s national territory , russia defense minister pavel grachev warned boris yeltsin that if chechnya broke free , there would be a domino effect in neighboring muslim - dominated areas . russia would run the risk of being cut in two . otherwise on the proliferation front , russian and american interests were aligned . the two nations were quick to agree to the george h . w . bush administration s megatons to megawatts proposal , announced in august 1992 , in which over 20 years russia would convert 500 tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear warheads into low - enriched uranium to be purchased by the u . s . to fuel power plants . the agreement was finalized under president clinton in 1993 , and everybody was happy . the russians were earning money from their nuclear expertise while reducing their overlarge nuclear arsenal ( as were the americans ) , and the americans had a reliable supply of energy - grade uranium for their nuclear - power industry . however , the following six years proved revelatory . putin summed them up well just recently : we gave you uranium ; you repaid us by bombing belgrade . what exactly did putin mean what was he summarizing in the oil and gas business , distribution is key . whoever controls the pipe servicing a field controls the product . by securing an energy supply corridor from the fields of the caspian sea region to europe , the west would provide for a significant supply of oil and gas to central and western europe by pipeline , and to the u . s . through load - out terminals in the nato sphere , in turkey , greece , and albania . the only trick would be to maintain stability along the pipeline from the caspian through the caucasus and the balkans to western europe ; the chosen solution was to create individual u . n . - nato protectorates from the six republics and two autonomous regions that made up yugoslavia before 1989 . nato s peace bombs served to undermine the last sovereign state that stood in the way of the west s colonization of the balkans . none of this was lost on the russians . they understood that there was nothing humanitarian in nato s kosovo aggression , and the alliance s cheap rhetoric was really cover for the west s ongoing oil - grab and the rolling expansions of nato , both of which continue to this day . moscow had always controlled the pipes that carried the former soviet union s oil and gas to western markets . much better , the americans reasoned , that the central asian republics should owe their future wealth , transit payments , and security to an imperial washington . stripped of her pipeline monopoly , her nuclear capacity diminished through obsolescence , her defense sector in decline from lack of resources , and burdened with a corrupt government , unsustainable foreign - debt payments , and a thieving elite , russia would be no more than a vast , disorganized , ineffective , and landlocked territory capable only of delivering raw materials ( and thousands of thermonuclear warheads ) to the west . and even the efficient exporting of raw materials , certain interests argued , would require western management . over the following decade the fracking revolution would change the face of the oil and gas industry ; now the united states , for example , was to become an exporter of oil , not merely an importer . but the pressure on russia did not cease : it has only intensified . the west s sanctions regime compels russia to live through a 21 st - century version of the medieval siege . in 2009 , it was sergey kiriyenko who first saw the saving opportunity . the west , which had focused on gaining control of russian gas and oil , had neglected uranium . the former yeltsin prime minister saw that profitable assets which were even then giving a good return could be had for a cheap price . he also knew that when the megatons to megawatts program ended in 2013 , the u . s . would have insufficient uranium to supply her industry . kiriyenko s proposal thus would give russia a significant claim on u . s . uranium assets . but that was not likely the driving force behind the plan . what was essential for the development of rosatom was increasing russia s supply of raw uranium , not settling old scores . after kiriyenko s presentation to the presidium , putin gave the go - ahead for rosatom to proceed to lock those assets up . the first step was the bid for 17 percent of uranium one that had so alarmed the company s principals and renaissance capital s promoters of the stock . uranium one quickly responded to kazakhstan s challenge to the company s ownership of the kazakh mines which russia had no discernible motive to disrupt and contacted canadian and u . s . diplomats , telling them they needed official written confirmation that the licenses were valid . cables flew to the u . s . state department , whose head was then mrs . clinton . in mid - june 2009 , according to a new york times report ( april 23 , 2015 ) , the american energy officer of the u . s . embassy in kazakhstan met with kazakh officials . three days later , writes the times , a wholly owned subsidiary of rosatom completed a deal for 17 percent of uranium one . that same month , bill clinton gave his now - famous half - million - dollar speech at moscow s kremlin - connected renaissance capital . within a year , continues the times , the russian government substantially upped the ante , with a generous offer to shareholders that would give [ russia ] a 51 percent controlling stake . but to pull that deal off , rosatom had to obtain the approval of the committee on foreign investment in the united states ( cfius ) , on which sat the committee s most important member , hillary clinton , whose husband was collecting millions in donations from people associated with uranium one . bill and hillary s long - serving praetorian guard , the fbi , even managed to run an investigation , and the department of justice a successful prosecution , of vadim mikerin , whom the doj describes as the former director of the pan american department of jsc techsnabexport ( teneX ) , a subsidiary of russia s state atomic energy corporation , for money - laundering and corrupt practices , without having to avail themselves of what were said to be suitcases of evidence gathered by an american informant within the rosatom crew , william campbell . that done , the justice department then gagged their informant . contrary to the agreement hillary struck with the obama administration in return for her appointment as the u . s . secretary of state , the clinton foundation s 145 million rake from individuals connected to uranium one was not reported , nor were the names of the donors . reporters would soon learn that asking for specifics from foundation spokesmen , former campaign and staff personnel , pretty much guarantees nobody s home . the giustra pals donations add up to some 50 million . where did the rest of the 145 million come from peter schweizer , author of clinton cash , told foX news that , according to his fbi sources , within the trove of evidence gathered by campbell is a recording of russian officials with this uranium company talking about making donations to the clinton foundation to gain favorable action . if true , the fbi would have uncovered the russian bribery plot before the obama administration approved the 2010 russian bid for 51 - percent ownership of uranium one , which russia through armZ , a subsidiary of rosatom fully owns today ( 100 percent , contrary to moscow s stated intentions in 2010 ) , and thereby controls 20 percent of u . s . uranium . why wasn t cfius informed about the bribery scandal why was the investigation and prosecution of mikerin hidden from congress why was it kept from the public , when every bit of unsubstantiated russian calumny is shouted from the rooftops was the small leverage over u . s . energy needs russia gained through the ownership of uranium one worth a 145 million payoff to the clintons rosatom contracts are calculated in the billions , meaning a 145 million campaign is not unreasonable , according to the standard practices of the international bribe market ; a ten - percent rake is the usual percentage taken of those bribes that are actually paid out . did russia overpay for the shares of uranium one in the 2013 buyout with the understanding that the lucky principals would send a sliver of their piece of the pie to the clintons giustra himself is said to have cashed out of uranium one for some 300 million , after which he donated 31 . 5 million to the clinton foundation . overall , the most compelling question is this : why would the russians , having such excellent kompromat on hillary and while enjoying such genial relations with madam reset , want a volatile and capricious trump in the white house instead of her they d had a bellyful of all that from their own boris yeltsin . hillary they knew ; trump they didn t . what of putin is he a bribe - giver is he so bold and confident a character as to step into the muddy waters of international corruption , involving himself with the clintons in the united states , a land that both amuses and confounds him despite the historical roots of putin s legal structures , favoring what he refers to as russia s champions , could they not collectively compose a proto - fascist structure not entirely unlike governor clinton s arkansas development and financial authority the utility of russia s state corporations to the nation depends almost entirely upon the character and competency of the khozyain and his subordinates . in self - interested hands , the overall structure as designed could lead to great harm . would not a rosatom management gone rogue exemplify the potential danger there is yet another consideration . when large sums move improperly from one pocket to another , the problem of leaving a trail of evidence can be alleviated with the help of a friendly offshore investment bank one like , say , renaissance . the complete buyout of a company done privately offers folks who are on the take a rare opportunity . did some other highly political benefactor step in and buy the shares at an inflated price from uranium one shareholders and then sell them at a loss to the russians at a previously agreed price ( there are all sorts of ways the rich can make new friends while expanding their circle of influence . ) who else might have benefited , besides the clintons , from alleged rosatom largesse all of these questions need to be answered . at the start of 2018 , the mainstream media have declared trump s obsession ( nbc news ) with uranium one to be his and his supporters attempt at distracting americans from his oft alleged collusion with russia to steal the 2016 presidential election . oddly enough , those who are working to establish ties between russia and trump have ties to the clintons , including matters related to uranium one . sydney powell at the daily caller ( mueller s hit squad covered for clinton and persecutes trump associates , december 6 ) outlines numerous connections between the lawyers who worked the mikerin bribery case and who today labor on the special counsel s trump investigatory team . among the relationships powell mentions , the first is the publicly admitted , close friendship between former fbi director james comey and former fbi director robert mueller , and their previous subordinates , rod rosenstein and andrew weissmann . deputy attorney general rod rosenstein named mueller as special counsel within seven days of comey s firing . in turn , mueller had a hand in placing mr . weissmann on the enron task force , allowing him to run rough - shod over most of houston , destroy arthur andersen llp and 85 , 000 jobs , and send four innocent merrill executives to prison in indictments for crimes he made up while he and his team hid the evidence that showed they were innocent . then there is mueller s protection of peter strzok , his lead investigator , who greatly assisted comey s effort to liberate hillary clinton from the legal consequences of her failure as secretary of state to protect u . s . national - security information via her infamous private server . weissmann s emailed praise and support for obama s deputy attorney general sally yates for her refusal to enforce president trump s travel ban further stirs the pot . ( yates claims she had to snitch on general flynn because his glancing reference to trump s intention to overturn obama s sanctions in a telephone conversation with russian ambassador kislyak days before trump was sworn in made him subject to blackmail . but that whole 145 million deal with the clinton foundation and the russian buyout of uranium one meh . ) on sunday , december 17 , true pundit posted a report on fbi deputy director andrew mccabe s years - long association with russian organized - crime figures and highly unusual front - running of investigations involving the boston bombers , the alleged iranian kidnapping of fbi agent robert levinson , and other cases involving russian figures normally left to lower - level field agents . such agents made up mccabe s various investigatory teams , but he did not share with them his findings nor any gleanings from his contacts with oleg deripaska , the multibillionaire victor in the bloody aluminum wars of the 1990 s , who figures prominently in mueller s indictment of paul manafort . add in mccabe s receipt of a 700 , 000 contribution to his wife s failed virginia state - senate campaign from virginia governor and longtime clinton operative , terry mcauliffe ( himself under investigation at the time ) ; mccabe s promotion of disgraced investigator peter strzok ; his links to democrat - linked fusion gps through his colleague , the recently demoted bruce ohr and his wife , nellie , a former fusion gps employee and cia spook , and team mueller looks like the tool of some very special interests , and not the immaculate public servants as advertised . for now , robert mueller s nearly year - long fruitless investigation of donald trump s alleged collaboration with russian officials rolls on . at this writing , it is off in the weeds of deutsche bank real - estate lending from a decade ago . yet the ultimate clinton scandal involves significant collusion with certain opportunistic russians , over the course of decades from the u . s . - organized and funded privatization debacle , to the 1998 imf - funded russian bond market collapse , to uranium one and represents an actual threat to american security and interests . source : < URL >

pence in israel . vice president mike pence is getting a warm reception in israel this week , in part because he brings news that the move of the u . s . embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem is ahead of schedule . jerusalem is israel s capital , pence said in a speech before the knesset , the israeli parliament . in the weeks ahead , our administration will advance its plan to open the u . s . embassy in jerusalem and the embassy will open by the end of next year . the vice president visited egypt and jordan before landing in israel on sunday evening . on monday , he had dinner with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu met with president reuven rivlin in jerusalem on tuesday . pro - life democrats at a pro - life event in chicago last week , democratic rep . dan lipinski spoke . he was the only democrat to do so . when the born - alive abortion survivors protection act passed the house of representatives on friday by a vote of 241 - 183 , only six democrats including lipinski voted for the bill . it s tough to be a pro - life democrat , and it s getting tougher . lipinski , a seven - term congressman , is getting serious primary opposition this year . in a rare move , two members of the illinois delegation have already endorsed lipinski s primary opponent . a poll released last week says that about 25 percent of democrats are pro - life , but you sure can t tell that by looking at the policies of the party . remembering lance sijan . lance sijan died 50 years ago this week , on jan . 22 , 1968 . his name is not well known to most americans , but air force academy graduates must commit his story to memory , as he is the only usafa graduate so far to receive the congressional medal of honor . in late 1967 his f - 4 was shot down over vietnam . sijan was badly wounded but nonetheless evaded capture for 46 days before being taken prisoner . following brutal torture , escape and recapture , and other remarkable acts of courage and heroism , sijan died in captivity . he was 25 years old . sijan was posthumously promoted to captain . in 1976 , president ford presented his family with his medal of honor . at the captain lance p . sijan plaza in his hometown of milwaukee is a monument with these words from the christian apologist g . k . chesterton : the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him , but because he loves what is behind him . you can read more of his story here . to spank or not to spank . singer kelly clarkson attracted a firestorm of media attention when she said she occasionally spanked her 3 - year - old daughter . this celebrity news was often paired in the media with a recent study from the university of texas saying spanking is bad for kids . most americans , though , are siding with clarkson . the general social study found that two - thirds of americans agree with the statement , it is sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good , hard spanking . according to world , spanking is legal in all 50 states . some states have restrictions on how parents can spank , and some states have outlawed spanking in schools , but no state has completely banned spanking at home .
pray for your pastor . for the colson center , i m john stonestreet with the point . in the old days , a couple facing marriage trouble talked to their pastor . then , that changed to the marriage counselor . today , as my pastor tells me , he s now third in line behind the counselor and the attorney . according to a gallup poll , clergy rank number 9 on the list of professionals americans trust the most : behind nurses , military officers , grade school teachers , medical doctors , pharmacists , police officers , day - care providers , and judges . only 25 percent of non - christians view clergy as ethical and trustworthy . and only 48 percent of christians view them that way there are many reasons for this , but as bill brown , head of our colson fellows program told me : pastors are held to a higher standard if they fall into sin . . . while there is forgiveness and restoration , they will be marked by it for the rest of their lives . . . that s why we serve with fear and trembling . just another reason why we should pray for our pastors .

the beginning of the year is a good time to reassess our spiritual practices , to make adjustments to the disciplines we already do , and to adopt new ones to help us grow in our relationship with god . in the previous article , we looked at prayer and particularly the use of the lord s prayer . in this article we will look at the largely neglected practice of fasting . our self - indulgent culture does not see the point in fasting , and even many christians put forward objections : it s unhealthy , it s legalistic , what we eat has no bearing on our spiritual lives as long as we eat with thankfulness , and a host of other arguments about why it isn t necessary or even . and while there are elements of truth in some of these objections , the deeper reality is that fasting has been a part of biblical religion for millennia . fasting in history the old testament contains numerous examples of fasting . these take a variety of forms and are done for various purposes , such as mourning sin ( e . g . lev . 16 : 29 - 31 , dan . 9 : 3 ) , seeking divine favor ( e . g . 2 sam . 12 : 6 , esther 4 : 16 ) , and for understanding the times ( dan . 10 : 3 cf . 10 : 12 ) . in the new testament , jesus fasted and he expected his followers to fast as well : note that in the sermon on the mount , he gives instructions for when , not if , you fast ( matt . 6 : 16 ) . in the first century church , believers fasted every wednesday and friday from dawn until 3 : 00 pm . the catholic and orthodox worlds have practiced fasting as well . these fasts , often of longer duration , generally involve in abstaining from certain foods , such as the old catholic practice of not eating meat on fridays . the entire season of lent and advent are traditionally spent in this kind of fast . although protestants have practiced fasting , it has never been a major part of protestant spirituality . early protestants reacted against it as an unscriptural imposition by the catholic church . we see this in the affair of the sausages that signaled the beginning of the swiss reformation ( 1522 ) . while some high church protestants such as anglo - catholics retain fasts within the church calendar , most protestants have effectively rejected fasting as legalism , in part out of reaction to the rigid rules for fasting in the traditional catholic church . while some individuals have continued the practice , it has fallen by the wayside for the average christian in the western world . in the global south , the region we used to call the developing world , fasting is a much more regular part of christian life , and these are the areas where we see the fastest growth of the gospel . for example , in some regions in africa where god s kingdom is advancing with power , christians fast every wednesday , breaking their fast in the evening together at a prayer meeting / bible study . so , fasting has been practiced throughout church history and is currently a basic christian discipline in the areas of the world where christianity is growing the quickest and having its greatest impact . the question is , why what is the purpose of fasting what are its benefits why fast fasting can have positive effects on all levels of life . physically , caloric restriction has been tied to longevity , and fasting gives our digestive system a rest . when we are digesting food , the body increases blood flow to the digestive organs to absorb nutrients . fasting allows that blood flow to be redirected to the brain , and many people report increased mental clarity and focus while fasting . fasting also can help us increase in discipline . in college , i regularly did a 36 hour fast from thursday dinner to saturday breakfast , and i found that i was far more focused and productive with my time the entire week . the self - control required for habitual fasting had a positive effect on my level of self - control in the rest of my life . on a spiritual level , fasting allows more time for prayer and kingdom work we might not otherwise be able to do , since we have freed up the time we would have spent in preparing and eating food . although we usually think of fasting only in relation to prayer , in luke 2 : 37 and acts 13 : fasting is associated with worship as well , reminding us that its purpose is to help us to connect with god . fasting brings us face to face with our radical dependence on god . we have so much stuff and so many resources available to us that it is very easy to rely on these things to carry us through difficult times . voluntarily stepping away from food reminds us that man does not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god . fasting disciplines both our souls and bodies appetites , desires , and use of time . it reminds us that our priorities in life are always to be spiritual , and it can help to increase our dependence on the lord in bringing our bodies into submission to him . as we learn dependence on god , our power in prayer and our authority over spiritual forces grows as well . jesus tells us that some kinds of demons will only come out with prayer and fasting ( matt . 17 : 21 ) . beyond dealing with the demonic , fasting and prayer is essential preparation for ministry : jesus fasted before beginning his ministry , as did leaders in the early church . the reason for this is again connected to spiritual power . shodankeh johnson , head of new harvest international ministry in sierra leone , west africa , believes that weekly , corporate fasting is essential for spiritual breakthroughs . this has been confirmed in the experience of mission agencies that have followed shodankeh s advice on this . learning to fast consult with your doctor before engaging in fasting , particularly if you have any medical conditions or are on any medications . scripture lists several approaches to fasting , ranging from abstaining from certain foods to abstaining from both food and drink ( including water ) for up to three days . fasts in the bible last from a single day to up to 40 days . given the range of options , there are almost certainly types of fasting you can engage in safely . minors should also not fast without medical approval and close supervision . if there are no medical conditions involved , here are suggestions to get you started . start small . don t plan on a 40 day fast consuming water only . you can always work your way up to more rigorous fasts if you feel yourself led to do that . the easiest way to begin is with either a dawn to dusk fast or a 24 - hour fast . if you choose the latter , don t be legalistic about the time ; the idea is to go from dinner to dinner without eating . for example , when you finish dinner on tuesday , do not eat again until wednesday dinner . you can extend this to 36 hours , so dinner tuesday to breakfast thursday , if you like , but it is probably best to start with the 24 - hour fast . you may drink during the day . juice , broth , coffee , etc . , are all ok , or you may choose to drink only water or water and tea with nothing in it ( i . e . non - caloric drinks ) . be aware that you may get headaches from coffee . i do not recommend diet sodas , however , as the artificial sweeteners produce the same insulin response as sugar , which may make your fast considerably more difficult . vitamins , etc . , are fine to take as well if you d like . you can and should be flexible about how you get started . see how you respond and adjust from there . some people will find the 24 - or 36 - hour water fast very easy ; others will barely make it through a 24 - hour juice fast . the important point is to start somewhere and adjust as needed . eventually you will find an approach that you can practice consistently . once you become habituated to that , you may make additional adjustments as well . if there are medical reasons that prevent you from fasting from food , consider fasting from something else , e . g . electronic media , television , or anything that will help remind you to turn your thoughts to god and of your dependence on him . or consider giving up desserts , alcohol , caffeine , meat , eggs , dairy . there is undoubtedly something you could fast from . it s only temporary , after all . the new year s challenge i know of no one and no ministry that is not looking for spiritual breakthroughs this year . commit yourself to a one - day a week , 24 - hour fast , and invite others in your church , ministry , small group , etc . , to join you . ideally , you could meet to break the fast together with bible study and prayer as is done in west africa , but even if that is not possible , try the fast , take it seriously , and see if some of the benefits described above , including spiritual breakthroughs , happen in your life and ministry .

to paraphrase mark twain , reports of the rift between science and christianity have been greatly exaggerated . scientist richard dawkins , the combative author of the god delusion , has said , faith can be very , very dangerous , and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong . i wonder why the good doctor doesn t just go ahead and tell us how he really feels seeing such vitriolic quotes from high - profile scientists such as dr . d , it s no wonder that so many christians believe that most scientists hate god , christians , and religious faith . the good news is , it is simply not true that s according to a fascinating new book , religion vs . science : what religious people really think , by elaine howard ecklund of rice university and christopher scheitle of west virginia university . as reported in christianity today , ecklund and scheitle found that , based on data from a nationally representative survey of 10 , 000 americans , evangelicals are just as likely as most americans to count scientists as close friends but they tend to assume their friends are the exceptions , that most scientists want nothing to do with them . and while only 40 percent of all scientists say they believe in god , and about half have no religious affiliation , ecklund and scheitle found that a full 65 percent of those working in practical scientific fields such as medicine and engineering identify as christians , including 24 percent as evangelicals . apparently there s a link between faith traditions that emphasize helping other people and the kinds of professions that actually do so who knew down through the centuries , of course , christians have been eager to help the sick and many of us have taken to heart god s call to be his stewards in the world , caring for and developing his creation , so these figures are no surprise . we re not doing quite as well in the basic and more theoretical sciences , however . ecklund and scheitle suspect there isn t as strong a connection between our religious values and basic science , observing , [ i ] t would be easier to see new medical discoveries as spiritually connected to the ideals of faith than it would be to see new scientific discoveries as promoting faith ideas . but of course the connection between scientific discovery and a christian worldview is as strong as an electric current running through water . years ago , chuck colson reminded us that many of the great scientists of history copernicus in astronomy and newton in physics , among them made epochal discoveries while operating out of a christian worldview . that worldview says that god created the universe out of nothing , that he has set up a series of observable , rational laws to govern it , and that mankind male and female has been created in his image with the god - given ability to discover things about the physical world and bring order and blessing to it . as the eminent historian rodney stark has written , christian theology was necessary for the rise of science . indeed yes , sometimes certain modern scientific trends and spokespeople have anti - religious agendas . but let s never fear the battle , remembering that when we engage in science , we are firmly on our heavenly father s home turf . ecklund and scheitle , for their part , suggest that our churches should take a more active role in recognizing and promoting science as a calling from god . they say that the church needs faith leaders to celebrate the scientists within their congregations , and they need these scientists to speak out about how scientific knowledge is not a threat to their faith . so while the rift between science and faith may have been greatly exaggerated , we still have some work to do . scientists and christianity : it s not what you may think scientific pursuit and faith in christ are not mutually exclusive , as eric has pointed out . click on the links below for further discussion of scientists and christianity .

things took an interesting turn on capitol hill in the ongoing drama and controversy of government transparency after cnn reported several sources alleged the house intelligence committee has refused to hand over a classified house intel memo after a request from senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr s staff requested a copy . the memo in question is a classified document created by rep . devin nunes ( r - ca ) that republicans are swearing reveals evidence that points to a scandal worse than watergate . cnn described the memo briefly : the four - page nunes memo alleges that the fbi withheld information from the fisa court judge who approved warrants on donald trump s team , including former campaign foreign policy adviser carter page . democrats claim the document is misleading . republicans are pushing for the memo to be released to the general public as soon as possible . senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley commented : based on what i know , i agree that as much of this information should be made public as soon as possible through the appropriate process . however , the house intelligence committee has kept the memo under wraps . along with the senate intelligence committee , the house intelligence committee has denied requests from the fbi and the justice department . npr reported there is no actual law that would be cause for the release of the memo , and republicans may decide to keep it classified for political reasons . but there is no requirement in law or other forcing function that would mandate the memo be released . and republicans could calculate that their political hand is stronger if they can discuss the cards they re holding without revealing them . npr also noted republicans allege the memo was a move on the part of the obama administration to conduct a politically motivated investigation . the baseline allegation appears to be that the obama administration used surveillance tools to target the trump campaign and that the russia probe is at root a politically motivated investigation . not only has the memo caught the attention of senators , it has caught the attention of americans as they managed to get the hashtag campaign releasethememo going . cnn reported it was spurred by a multitude of twitter accounts that were set up within the past week . along with that , several congressional members took to twitter calling for the memo to be released . earlier this morning , i examined the classified , four - page memo from houseintelcomm regarding the fbi , doj , and the so - called russiancollusion . to put it simply , wow . i joined the call to releasethememo . americans deserve truth and transparency . after reviewing the memo , i believe it is in the best interest of our nation that it be released to the public . the american people deserve to know the truth about the troubling information contained in this document . releasethememo there has been a real attempt to undermine this president it comes from the scariest of places . the key reason all americans need to see this memo is that it names names . why don t the democrats want the american people to know the truth releasethememo democrats , however , have little to say about the memo that could be considered good . sen . mark warner ( d - Va ) commented : i have not seen the memo , but i think it is sloppy , careless , and again , i think has no grounding in fact . it s been reported the president is leaning towards the decision to release the memo ; however , white house officials have denied he has made any concrete decision . featured image by mark wilson / getty images .
maybe donald trump s first campaign chairman , paul manafort , should fire his attorneys . it seems that they accidentally filed a document in court that indicated something big was going on inside of manafort s business . the attorneys filed a one - page memo in with a normal scheduling motion . that document was apparently prepared by an investigator or one of the defense attorneys . the document was called doj , osc and the press . it seemed , that its purpose was to build support for the defense . poLitico reported that there was : improper contacts between the prosecution team now headed by special counsel robert mueller and the media . manafort started his firm , davis manafort partners international . the document indicated that somehow a journalist received copies of the company s internal documents . manafort s firm worked with russian and ukrainian oligarchs . mueller has been particularly interested in those dealings due to potential collusion between trump s campaign and russia during the 2016 presidential election . manafort traveled to the ukraine 138 times , according to business insider . according to the memo , one of the firm s staffers let a reporter look at the company s computerized records on the same date that prosecutors got their affidavit for a seizure warrant last october . the document used the standard fbi acronym for a confidential source , poLitico reported : in the winter of 2017 ( sic 2016 ) employee of dmi cs - 1 permitted the reporter to view material on a hard drive copy of dmi s electronic files . government obtained warrant for the hard drive . the memo that was included along with the intended documents does not list any specific journalist . however , it does include the associated press and a mention of one of its articles on april 12 , 2017 . that story wrote that the dmi s records included some sort of alleged payments to manafort that ukrainians recorded in the black ledger . ukrainian anti - corruption investigators retrieved this ledger . the associated press article was bylined by jack gillum , chad day , and jeff horwitz . it read : financial records newly obtained by the associated press confirm that at least 1 . 2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to manafort s name were actually received by his u . s . consulting firm . according to poLitico : citing the same seizure warrant affidavit , the notes filed by manafort s defense team also relates that the associated press gave maloni copies of two memos manafort wrote to a ukranian oligarch in 2005 about work for ukraine s party of regions . the defense filing suggests the memos came from the one of the reporters who wrote the april 12 ap story . a spokesperson for manafort , jason maloni , had no comment about the apparent leak , and manafort s lead defense attorney , kevin downing , refused to reply to a message from poLitico asking for a comment . typically , the spokesperson for the mueller team s office did not give a comment either . manafort and his business partner at dmi , rick gates , were both indicted by mueller on october 27 , 2017 . the charges included failing to register as foreign lobbyists and money laundering . after the men entered not guilty pleas , the judge assigned them to house arrest . at this time , no trial date has been indicated . featured image via getty images / alex wong .
flowing like a pink river , scores of women in their trademark headgear marched all over the world , just as they did a year ago . carrying signs with urgent messages , the generations took to the streets to bring attention to the many concerns women bear . a few men marched , also . over the past year , the dam holding back accumulated grievances has broken . women are insulted at being paid less ; women are outraged by the sexual harassment they have endured ; women are wearied from the power differential they experience in nearly every sphere . women believe that they have a rightful claim to be treated equally . women vote ; women are breadwinners ; and women are gifted for governing , especially in this fractious time when male egos pose barriers to compromise for the common good . it is past time for recalibrating the calculus of gender in the workplace , the public square , the home and the church . some have suggested that this is nothing short of a revolution , and the sensitivities these marches are stoking are having an impact on the social landscape . men are examining their actions , what they say , and maybe even some of their assumptions about women . this past week i happened to arrive at the mailbox at the same time the regular carrier was there . he said , i owe you an apology for something i said to you last summer . i was puzzled and asked , for what he recalled having remarked that i looked hot ; i recall that it was a very warm day . he was concerned that he had offended me . it was not a sexual flirtation , and i did not take it as such . yet the fact that he interrogated himself about the possible misunderstanding and then brought it up after several months speaks volumes about the growing sensitivity to how the genders interact . the threshold of pain is palpable in our national psyche . the unrelenting cycle of threatening breaking news wears down our capacity for compassion , hope and patience . yet , pain can be a fertile soil for seeds to sprout and new life to come . as mary tyler moore put it , pain nourishes courage . you can t be brave if you ve only had wonderful things happen to you . she is right , and our times call for courage . the patriarchal chaos of the presidency has prompted an unprecedented number of women to run for public office . black women , in particular , are leading the way , astonished that the majority of white women voted for the current president . women contend that their voices are required to bring good governance to the regnant system , all but broken . yet women are often the brunt of jokes in the old boys club of the senate or the house , seen as interlopers to be tolerated but not welcomed as colleagues . the deal - cutting usually excludes them . further , statehouses hold few women governors ; as of 2017 , 22 states have never had a female . as a new york times article put it sunday , gender can alienate as well as energize . levels of education , race , whether a woman is rural or urban , all contribute to the possibility that gender concerns can galvanize an ongoing movement or not . even though the hard work of gender equality in modern times began in the 60 s , it is not finished . rarely do persons voluntarily relinquish power , and the pressure is building . while other women were marching , i was meeting with members of central baptist theological seminary s women s leadership initiative and their mentors for training on how to address race and justice issues . that will be part of the necessary work ahead as we find ways to work together for a more just society , not expecting black women to carry a disproportionate burden for making things right . there is much to do beyond marching as i attended a martin luther king jr . rally last week , i observed that there was a concerted effort to get people registered to vote . this most basic civic privilege is often thought to be a futile pursuit , especially when districts are shifted and new forms of identification required . voting remains a critical expression of voice and power , as the recent defeat of roy moore at the hands of women , primarily black , demonstrates . scholarly writers and common parlance suggest that the future belongs to women . i agree if it is a balancing of power that ensures safety in the workplace , equality in compensation , and new value accorded to the leadership practices that women bring . globally , girls still lag behind in educational opportunities , as malala has so courageously brought to the world s attention . educating women and girls raises the level of the whole community , as the findings of many studies document . gender equality is even a more urgent issue for developing nations , and those with privilege wisely join in advocating for them . together , we march into the future .

the us conference of mayors was invited to the white house for a discussion about infrastructure . yet just prior to the meeting , trump s department of justice sent out letters to 23 so - called sanctuary cities , threatening them if they do not comply with the federal deportation agenda . now , new orleans mayor mitch landrieu , the president of the us conference of mayors , is backing out of the meeting , saying that the trump administration is attempting to start a discussion under false pretenses . he and other mayors have indicated they doubt a meeting with trump will be productive . cnn reports , landrieu told reporters in washington that he would not go to the meeting under false pretenses , complaining that the meeting is supposed to focus on infrastructure but that the justice department s sanctuary cities move changed the equation . an attack on one of our cities mayors who is following the constitution is an attack on all of us . i will not be attending that meeting , he said . cities around the nation have chosen not to cooperate with trump s administration when it comes to immigrant communities . the trump administration expects them to share information that will help deport those who are here without documentation , but cities argue that overenforcement of immigration laws by local police is detrimental to preventing crime . indeed , under hardline anti - immigrant sheriff joe arpaio , violent crimes , sexual assaults , and attacks against children all rose as he dedicated his department to hunting immigrants , despite a national decline in violent crime during that time . not only that , but immigrant communities who are scared of law enforcement are less likely to cooperate as witnesses , making it more difficult to catch the actual criminals . as immigrant communities actually commit crime at a lower rate than natives , the effect of that cannot be overstated . landrieu is not the only mayor who is now refusing to attend the meeting and they re not all democrats . cnn goes on to report , new york city s de blasio also tweeted that he would not attend . i will not be attending today s meeting at the white house after realdonaldtrump s department of justice decided to renew their racist assault on our immigrant communities , he wrote . it doesn t make us safer and it violates america s core values . at least one republican mayor has decided not to attend the event . a spokesperson for the us conference of mayors also told cnn that elizabeth kautz , the republican mayor of burnsville , minnesota , has declined the invite due to the justice department . kautz is a past president of the us conference of mayors . trump s administration argues that the lack of cooperation from cities puts people in danger , but that s not the reality . what it actually does is protect immigrants who do not have documents and are not commiting crimes . trump doesn t care whether those he deports are criminals or not trump s ice is raiding workplaces , busses , and activists . trump himself pulled protections for the dreamers , who have been here since children and are more american than he is in many ways . he s attacked refugees and those here legally as well as those who came here without documents . the real goal is to deport everyone he can that isn t white . the trump admin has no problem with russian birth tourists , and trump has said he d rather have immigrants from norway . whyever could that be featured image via mike theiler - pool / getty images

here s something strange , the afterglow from last year s kilonova is continuing to brighten headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next in august of 2017 , a major breakthrough occurred when scientists at the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) detected gravitational waves that were believed to be caused by the collision of two neutron stars . this source , known as gw170817 / grb , was the first gravitational wave ( gw ) event that was not caused by the merger of two black holes , and was even believed to have led to the formation of one . as such , scientists from all over the world have been studying this event ever since to learn what they can from it . for example , according to a new study led by the mcgill space institute and department of physics , gw170817 / grb has shown some rather strange behavior since the two neutron stars colliding last august . instead of dimming , as was expected , it has been gradually growing brighter . the study that describes the team s findings , titled brightening x - ray emission from gw170817 / grb 170817 a : further evidence for an outflow , recently appeared in the astrophysical journal letters . the study was led by john ruan of mcgill university s space institute and included members from the canadian institute for advanced research ( cifar ) , northwestern university , and the leicester institute for space and earth observation . chandra images showing the x - ray afterglow of the gw170817 / grb event . credit : nasa / cxc / mcgill university / j . ruan et al . for the sake of their study , the team relied on data obtained by nasa s chandra x - ray observatory , which showed that the remnant has been brightening in the x - ray and radio wavelengths in the months since the collision took place . as daryl haggard , an astrophysicist with mcgill university whose research group led the new study , said in a recent chandra press release : usually when we see a short gamma - ray burst , the jet emission generated gets bright for a short time as it smashes into the surrounding medium then fades as the system stops injecting energy into the outflow . this one is different ; it s definitely not a simple , plain - jane narrow jet . what s more , these x - ray observations are consistent with radiowave data reported last month by another team of scientists , who also indicated that it was continuing to brighten during the three months since the collision . during this same period , x - ray and optical observatories were unable to monitor gw170817 / grb because it was too close to the sun at the time . however , once this period ended , chandra was able to gather data again , which was consistent with these other observations . as john ruan explained : when the source emerged from that blind spot in the sky in early december , our chandra team jumped at the chance to see what was going on . sure enough , the afterglow turned out to be brighter in the x - ray wavelengths , just as it was in the radio . collisions of neutron stars produce powerful gamma - ray bursts and heavy elements like gold ( credit : dana berry , skyworks digital , inc . ) this unexpected behavior has led to a serious buzz in the scientific community , with astronomers trying to come up with explanations as to what type of physics could be driving these emissions . one theory is a complex model for neutron star mergers known as cocoon theory . in accordance with this theory , the merger of two neutron stars could trigger the release of a jet that shock - heats the surrounding gaseous debris . this hot cocoon around the jet would glow brightly , which would explain the increase in x - ray and radiowave emissions . in the coming months , additional observations are sure to be made for the sake of confirming or denying this explanation . regardless of whether or not the cocoon theory holds up , any and all future studies are sure to reveal a great deal more about this mysterious remnant and its strange behavior . as melania nynka , another mcgill postdoctoral researcher and a co - author on the paper indicated , gw170817 / grb presents some truly unique opportunities for astrophysical research . this neutron - star merger is unlike anything we ve seen before , she said . for astrophysicists , it s a gift that seems to keep on giving . it is no exaggeration to say that the first - ever detection of gravitational waves , which took place in february of 2016 , has led to a new era in astronomy . but the detection of two neutron stars colliding was also a revolutionary accomplishment . for the first time , astronomers were able to observe such an event in both light waves and gravitational waves . in the end , the combination of improved technology , improved methodology , and closer cooperation between institutions and observatories is allowing scientists to study cosmic phenomena that was once merely theoretical . looking ahead , the possibilities seem almost limitless further reading : chandra x - ray observatory , the astrophysical journal letters the post here s something strange , the afterglow from last year s kilonova is continuing to brighten appeared first on universe today . source : < URL >
revisiting black nationalism and the national question economic disparities , police brutality , inequalities et al . go together with capitalism . i was privileged to learn from and work with harry haywood . most if not all readers of the black agenda report know his legacy and history in the black struggle . if not , please do so . he viewed blacks as an oppressed nation in the black belt south and an oppressed minority in the north . the black struggle demanded its independence for true liberation . haywood said that the merits of black nationalism required an independent course for the movement ; to shake off the dead hand of liberalism , paternalism , gradualism , and dependency . it needed a revolutionary program consistent with sentiments of the black masses . haywood ' s view necessitated that the black independent struggle for self - determination is necessary to connect with the revolutionary working - class movement to bring about u . s . socialism - - and to end black oppression . haywood said that it was not enough to just talk about whether you desire integration or separation . both maintain their issues . black nationalism isolated and detached does not bring about black liberation . turning money over to the black community that originates and stays in the black community is a pipe dream if you understand imperialism . developing black businesses as a way forward is yet another empty basket . different groupings and formations today have adopted pieces of haywood s worldview . black community organizing with only the aim of making things better is temporary at best . the movement to end police brutality is an example . malcolm x got it right . economic disparities , police brutality , inequalities et al . go together with capitalism . malcolm still did not say what must replace it . he was moving on that track . on the integration end , there continues to be a trend that wrongly places the black petty bourgeois at the helm . dissing trump and voting for bernie sanders draws us no closer to black liberation . how many of us think that we will obtain true equality through these methods we in the black left still grapple with trying to put black liberation on a proper course using black nationalism . different groupings and formations today have adopted pieces of haywood s worldview . i suggest that we thoroughly examine haywood s premise , and emulate it according to today s current environment . yes , building black anti - capitalist , anti - imperialist , and anti - racist formations put us in the right direction . getting together to do joint work around common goals remains essential , but is limited . it looks like we have to help to build or re - build the revolutionary working class movement . that is , if harry haywood s view is followed . as the most oppressed and the vanguard of the working class movement , we learned our lessons . why not apply them dr . morgan can be reached at [ email protected ] .

justice department demands documents and threatens to subpoena 23 jurisdictions as part of 8 u . s . c . 1373 compliance review the department of justice today sent the attached letters to 23 jurisdictions , demanding the production of documents that could show whether each jurisdiction is unlawfully restricting information sharing by its law enforcement officers with federal immigration authorities . all 23 of these jurisdictions were previously contacted by the justice department , when the department raised concerns about laws , policies , or practices that may violate 8 u . s . c . 1373 , a federal statute that promotes information sharing related to immigration enforcement and with which compliance is a condition of fy2016 and fy2017 byrne jag awards . the letters also state that recipient jurisdictions that fail to respond , fail to respond completely , or fail to respond in a timely manner will be subject to a department of justice subpoena . i continue to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of their communities and their residents at risk , said attorney general jeff sessions . protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law . we have seen too many examples of the threat to public safety represented by jurisdictions that actively thwart the federal government s immigration enforcement enough is enough . failure to comply with section 1373 could result in the justice department seeking the return of fy2016 grants , requiring additional conditions for receipt of any fy2017 byrne jag funding , and / or jurisdictions being deemed ineligible to receive fy2017 byrne jag funding . the following jurisdictions received the document request today : chicago , illinois ; cook county , illinois ; new york city , new york ; state of california ; albany , new york ; berkeley , california ; bernalillo county , new mexico ; burlington , vermont ; city and county of denver , colorado ; fremont , california ; jackson , mississippi ; king county , washington ; lawrence , massachusetts ; city of los angeles , california ; louisville metro , kentucky ; monterey county , california ; sacramento county , california ; city and county of san francisco , california ; sonoma county , california ; watsonville , california ; west palm beach , florida ; state of illinois ; and state of oregon .

brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez today announced that an off - duty new york city police officer has been arraigned on a 14 - count indictment in which he is charged with first - degree robbery and other charges for allegedly robbing a man of cash , jewelry and a cellphone at gunpoint and pistol - whipping him outside of a bushwick nightclub . district attorney gonzalez said , this defendant s alleged brazen and criminal behavior was in direct contradiction to the oath he took to protect and serve . he then allegedly made a deplorable situation worse by falsely accusing multiple individuals of robbing him . we will now seek to hold him accountable . the district attorney identified the defendant as anthony delacruz , 34 . he was arraigned today before brooklyn supreme court justice danny chun on a 14 - count indictment in which he is charged with two counts of first - degree robbery , two counts of second - degree robbery , one count of third - degree robbery , two counts of second - degree assault , one count of third - degree assault , one count of second - degree menacing , two counts of third - degree falsely reporting an incident , two counts of distinctive number ; form of number plates ; trailers , and one count of petit larceny . bail was set at 100 , 000 bond or 50 , 000 cash and the defendant , who was suspended today by the nypd following his arrest , was ordered to return to court on march 21 , 2018 . he faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the top count . the district attorney said that , according to the investigation , on may 28 , 2016 at approximately 3 : 30 a . m . , in the vicinity of wyckoff avenue and grove street , near the el mekkah bar and grill , officers responded to a 911 call for shots fired . responding officers were allegedly told by officer delacruz who did not initially identify himself as a police officer or state that he had fired his service weapon that he was off - duty and in his personal vehicle when he was surrounded by several individuals who stole his gold chain , rolex watch and a gold ring before fleeing . officer delacruz allegedly said that he then chased after the perpetrators and exchanged gunfire with them , firing his gun once and there were possibly two shots returned . while on scene , officer delacruz allegedly pointed to a group of people who he said were involved in the robbery . all were taken into custody , and video evidence taken from el mekkah definitively showed that none of the men identified by officer delacruz were involved in the alleged robbery . the men were visible on camera in a different location from where the alleged robbery occurred . the officer was taken to a hospital , where nypd personnel determined that he was not forthcoming about details , and not in possession of his shield while armed and therefore unfit for duty . upon further investigation , officer delacruz and an unidentified accomplice are allegedly captured on video confronting another man , whose identity is known to the district attorney , who was hiding behind a car . the video further shows officer delacruz allegedly pointing his service weapon at that man . furthermore , according to the investigation , the three men go off camera and when they return to camera view the unidentified accomplice is carrying clothing and sneakers and he and officer delacruz walk away . the victim can later be seen on camera dressed only in a t - shirt , boxer shorts and with no shoes . the victim was allegedly pistol - whipped by the defendant and dna recovered from the muzzle of the officer s gun belonged to the victim . a shell casing recovered on the scene matched the defendant s gun , the investigation found . during the course of the investigation , officer delacruz identified the pistol - whipped victim as one of the men who robbed him . charges that were filed in connection with that alleged incident were later dismissed .

a new kind of propulsion system that doesn t need propellant . it converts electricity into thrust and vice versa . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next some of the best things in science are elegant and simple . a new propulsion system being developed in spain is both those things , and could help solve a growing problem with earth s satellites : the proliferation of space junk . researchers at universidad carlos iii de madrid ( uc3m ) and the universidad polit cnica de madrid ( upm ) in spain are patenting a new kind of propulsion system for orbiting satellites that doesn t use any propellant or consumables . the system is basically a tether , in the form of an aluminum tape a couple kilometers long and a couple inches wide , that trails out from the satellite . the researchers call it a space tie . this is a disruptive technology because it allows one to transform orbital energy into electrical energy and vice versa without using any type of consumable . gonzalo s nchez arriaga , uc3m . the lightweight space tie is rolled up during launch , and once the satellite is in orbit , it s deployed . once deployed , the tape can either convert electricity into thrust , or thrust into electricity . the spanish researchers behind this say that the space - ties will be used in pairs . the system is based on what is called a low - work - function tether . a special coating on the tether has enhanced electron emission properties on receiving sunlight and heat . these special properties allow it to function in two ways . this is a disruptive technology because it allows one to transform orbital energy into electrical energy and vice versa without using any type of consumable , said gonzalo s nchez arriaga , ram n y cajal researcher at the bioengineering and aerospace engineering department at uc3m . as a satellite loses altitude and gets closer to earth , the tether converts that thrust - caused - by - gravity into electricity for the spacecraft systems to use . when it comes to orbiting facilities like the international space station ( iss ) , this tether system could solve an annoying problem . every year the iss has to burn a significant amount of propellant to maintain its orbit . the tether can generate electricity as it moves closer to earth , and this electricity could replace the propellant . with a low - work function tether and the energy provided by the solar panel of the iss , the atmospheric drag could be compensated without the use of propellant , said arriaga . unlike current propulsion technologies , the low - work function tether needs no propellant and it uses natural resources from the space environment such as the geomagnetic field , the ionospheric plasma and the solar radiation . gonzalo s nchez arriaga , uc3m . for satellites with ample on - board power , the tether would operate in reverse . it would use electricity to provide thrust to the space craft . this is especially useful to satellites near the end of their operational life . rather than languish in orbit for a long time as space junk , the derelict satellite could be forced to re - enter earth s atmosphere where it would burn up harmlessly . the space - tie system is based on what s called lorentz drag . lorentz drag is an electrodynamic effect . ( electrodynamics enthusiasts can read all about it here . ) i won t go too deeply into it because i m not a physicist , but the spanish researchers suggest that the lorentz drag can be easily observed by watching a magnet fall through a copper tube . here s a video . space organizations have shown interest in the low - work - function tether , and the spanish team is getting the word out to experts in the usa , japan , and europe . the next step is the manufacture of prototypes . the biggest challenge is its manufacturing because the tether should gather very specific optical and electron emission properties , says s nchez arriaga . the spanish ministry of economy , industry and competitiveness has awarded the spanish team a grant to investigate materials for the system . the team has also submitted a proposal to the european commission s future and emerging technologies ( fet - open ) consortium for funding . the fet - open project would be foundational because it considers the manufacturing and characterization of the first low - work - function tether and the development of a deorbit kit based on this technology to be tested on a future space mission . if funded , it would be a stepping stone to the future of low - work - function tethers in space sanchez arriaga concluded . in this video , gonzalo sanchez arriaga explains how the system works . if you don t speak spanish , just turn on subtitles . the post a new kind of propulsion system that doesn t need propellant . it converts electricity into thrust and vice versa . appeared first on universe today . source : < URL >
the archon invasion , they re here headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next dear infected and afflicted , we are the dropouts . we are ephraim gregory nicholas romanov rasputin moscovitch , fourth generation descendant of the formerly secret romanov / rasputin bloodline and colonel ryan j . arlington , former engineer for a u . s . a . army unit based in a secret deep underground military base , the location of which will remain secret , for now . ephraim dropped out of high school and colonel arlington went awol . dropouts all have their personal reasons for dropping out and the shared realization of corruption . high school dropouts may lack the vocabulary to adequately explain dropping out , but are often the most astute at sensing corruption reasoning dropping out . the indoctrination of the postmodern public education system restricts thinking and inhibits communication . only after dropping out could ephraim effectively communicate his reasons for doing so . dropouts know something is wrong , if only intuitively , and exit . dropouts frequently lack the education , diluted with martial training and the prescribed vocabulary thereof , to be able to properly explain themselves , but dropouts know . scholastic bureaucracy was built for multiplication of human monoculture and employment of teachers rather than enlightenment of students . because of indoctrination rather than instruction , ephraim dropped out . all dropouts know something is wrong , intuitively or exactly , and perform the only moral act at their disposal , leave . after dropping out , one begins answering questions about the immersion in dehumanization , whether through school or the military . dropouts are people whose morality and curiosity engages , increases so much they have to answer the questions that arise as to corruption , people who realize the overall wrong and cease participation in it as much as humanly possible . colonel ryan j . arlington dropped out from the upper echelon of the global military industrial complex , much later in life and from a much higher position than ephraim , but because of corruption the same . the colonel was a high level operative whose clearance was so high , he didn t have an official clearance , nor did he have a rank or serial number , nor was his unit named , nor is their base known publicly . the unit operates so secretively there is no official record of it or the colonel at all . for the colonel to dropout he had to go awol and live on the lamb permanently , while ephraim had to face the stigma of being constantly labeled uneducated and unofficial . being a dropout requires one actively surmount such obstacles . dropouts cannot be lazy , contrary to popular opinion . currently we are being hunted down by the very global military industrial complex to which the colonel gave over thirty years of his life to , because we are dropouts who know . we are being hunted because we know secrets , to be specific , we hold the most diabolical series of secrets to ever concern humanity . because of the secrets we know about the threats to humanity , our existence is threatened . because our existence is threatened in multiplicity , we are revealing our secrets now . dropouts are far more trustworthy than any insider . ruffian copouts , credentialed bowouts and intellectual sellouts , all lie the same , all the time . dropouts are unofficial and unaccredited , but honest , we have to be because we are outside their game . as noted we are being hunted down by killing machines of great capability and have nothing to lose , as most all dropouts . but more importantly , as dropouts , we have nothing to gain . dropouts are consistently more trustworthy and more honest than copouts , sellouts and bowouts because we have nothing to gain . people are trained to ignore dropouts . these same people lend complete trust to official copouts , bowouts and sellouts and are repeatedly tricked . people revere collegiate and corporate credentials , and extensive militaristic ties and corporate experience , but these aren t evidence of honesty , but commitment to lies . if you spend any time out from under the wing of institutions , you know it takes honesty to dropout . no degree reflects honesty , however dropping out indicates plenty of it . to live outside the box you have to be actively observant and to survive for any length of time you have to be honest . dropouts are the realest people on earth . jesus , buddha , gandhi , malcolm x and martin luther king jr . were all dropouts . being a dropout is a serious qualification . we dropped out because of perpetual corruption and war . the global military industrial complex , including your local law enforcement , is the only growing industry on the planet . becoming a pair of muted boots to step on people at the whim of strangers is the easy way to earn a living with benefits , it s a copout . anybody can work for the biggest industry on the planet , as long as you adopt notions of legality and stomp out any sense of morality , and the same goes for being a corporate bowout or sellout . it takes honesty to dropout . signing up with uniformed bullies in support of the global military industrial complex is easy , but it s a lie . dropping out , living life according the golden rule , is always difficult , especially in an economy based on indiscreet war , but it s honest . the machinery of the war world is set up for copouts , bowouts and sellouts . and dropouts tend to be the ones most well positioned to be grinded up by their corruption . and alternatively are usually the only ones who stand up to it . war results in more war . the drug war builds prisons instead of schools , motivates contraband gangs and reduces the quality of life , pushing half of society to conclude narcotic escape is a decent choice , even if it risks prison time , or poisoning . in the same way war leads to buildup of terrible war machines , terrorists and terrorism , copout countries . all war destroys the environment . all war enslaves all people . all war is war on humanity and entirety . similar such exploits inspired jesus to curse the military industrial complex in his father s house two - thousand years ago . dropouts reject corrupt tradition , and toss tables , and that s what we re here to do . they are lying to you . that s what jesus said too . practically everything you know is a lie . and practically every lie is related to the concealment of the bloody web of war , to hide horrors and inspire enlistment . practically everything you thought was education and valuable tradition , is simply part of a model to compel you to like what you do ; stay in your place in the pyramid system holding down the many for the benefit of the few . and even though practically everything you know is a lie and all the lies weaved by the oligarchies for the last couple thousand years have been to keep the many below , enslaved and ignorant , the lies are all mitigated to unimportant tangents , inconsequential relative to the secrets of our current quandary . the military industrial complex has run the world for thousands of years and it s all lies . but the secrets we re revealing now are much bigger than humanity s prolonged subjugation to martial rule and the lies to maintain such . ephraim is a dropout from a family of royal exiles , the direct descendant of olga romanov and gregory rasputin . because of his birthright , he was given secrets . because of the colonel s military experience he learned secrets as well . when put together , the information formed an understanding of the world more complete than any before , of a situation more complex than any before . ephraim s main secret , which trivialized the millennia long rule of the global military industrial complex , has been kept secret for millennia by very powerful cabals and kingdoms , including the romanovs . the secret has been implemented by royalty , religious cults , aristocracies , corporations and factions endlessly throughout history to control people and benefit from that control and has in fact been used to instill the order of the military industrial complex too . the secret however is not a political trick , it s a biological tick . the secret is a fluke , the human fluke and its parasitic behavior modification of mankind . the human fluke has been our constant companion , always reducing the human narrative . nearly everyone has been infected at one point or another and somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty - five percent of the world are hosts to a parasite at any given time . the parasitic predicament has influenced individuals and collectives since the beginning . practically all children are exposed to it and many never rid themselves of the affliction , some live their entire life knowing nothing but a steady stream of unconsciousness , hosts acting out parasitic impulses . mankind s subjection to parasitic behavior modification has shaped the world . there are numerous human flukes resulting in infections of varying severity . yet all the human flukes live in one of two ways , resulting in one of two extremes of modified behavior . the slightly more common type is the bacterial dependent fluke , the other is the fungal dependent fluke . they cocoon themselves within bacterial or fungal clusters and attach to the human nervous system to obtain nutrients and modify our behavior . the bacterial dependent infestations result in tolerant , passive behavior , like sheep . the fungal infections result in scheming , aggressive behavior , like coyotes . this parasitic predicament , like everything in nature , becomes balanced , and in this case in an eloquent dis - symbiosis favoring the parasites . the different parasites develop interdependent balance with the bacterial and fungal clusters as well as their hosts , and more complexly , they relate to each other through modifying the behavior of the host . the parasitically guided interaction between people made sheepish or coyote - like is traditionally viewed as some sort of right wing / left wing political constant , but is actually the result of biological duress . the flukes result in evil or total toleration of outright evil . the behavior of about eighty - five percent of us originates not from normal processes , but is a fluke . the flukes are frequently mistaken for tumors , or cysts , or meningitis by both ignorant and insistent physicians . they normally attach themselves to the spinal cord or major nerves around the neck and through the bacterial or fungal clusters leech sustenance and eventually basically control their human hosts through insistent primordial parasitic impulses they employ through tapping into nerve endings . the tolerant , passive and bullied , those who seek to be controlled in order to survive are host to bacterial dependent flukes . the authoritarian and selfish , those who place themselves above all else with reckless abandon , those who seek to control in order to survive , are host to fungal dependent flukes . the flukes , despite being among the lowest life forms in the universe , simply seek to survive and control their hosts simply as a means to do so , but in the process degrade the human condition individually and collectively . being severely skinny is indicative of fungal dependent flukes . hosts to bacterial dependent flukes tend to bloat , otherwise there are no immediate discernible physical symptoms . there are many alchemical antidotes however most the diagnosis procedures and treatments are unnecessarily risky . alchemical cures involve calculations of quantity , potency and frequency of dose pertaining to the particular individual and the particular fluke . mercury , cyanide and large quantities of gold are active ingredients in these remedies . in appropriate dilution the concoctions kill the parasites and leave the host unharmed . if the dilutions are miscalculated the host can be killed . there are holistic cures too , secretively exchanged among nomads and monks for millennia . the parasites cannot thrive or long survive in a host with a vegan diet . massive amounts of almonds and apricots eaten will eventually kill the flukes . in stomach acid the combination produces therapeutic cyanide which kills parasites . certain extracts of wormwood , tobacco and cloves can kill the flukes too , however we are unsure of the exact quantities , modes of delivery and time periods required for effectiveness . practicing yoga or tai chi hasten the results of these holistic cures , but even still the apricots and almonds cure requires up to three months of eating as many almonds and apricots as you can along with vegan diet . there is one practical cure . and it was long ago made contraband and is mostly still . the most practical cure is the consumption of marijuana . it s safe , works quickly and is inexpensive , relieving the host of the parasite in weeks , while just one dose is capable of loosening the parasitic grip on the nervous system . the primary reason marijuana is globally prohibited is because of this , because it kills flukes . and those in the know who use and foster the parasitic predicament for their own parasitic gains made it so . adding to the complexity of the dis - symbiotic relationship of the fluke and man are the occult who know and manipulate the infected . they have tried to restrict knowledge of all curatives and access to the most reasonable one ; marijuana . the global drug war began with the prohibition of marijuana and hemp . most realize this was to protect business interests , make the rich richer and in turn keep poor people poor , but most don t realize there was much , much more . parasitic behavioral modification has influenced all of history . people announce deductive reasoning for their actions , why they think the way they do and yet frequently , eighty - five percent of the time , foreign biological impulses are controlling their motivations . their reasoning , however complicated , is just vocalization of fungal or bacterial impulses controlling them . scientists are well aware of parasitic behavior modification in the animal world , but most refuse to consider the possibility of human flukes . others will openly acknowledge various such infections , but won t address it further . they can t . of all the scientifically acknowledged behavior modifying parasites , toxoplasma gondii is the most researched and understood . toxoplasma gondii depends on felines to reproduce and uses rats to gain access to cats in this mortal dis - symbiosis . it supposedly doesn t harm cats , but rats host to toxoplasma gondii lose all sense of self - preservation and mortal danger . the toxoplasma gondii infested rats bowout to cats , no longer afraid of the scent of feline danger . the rat likely has its own personal , logical reasons for making an introduction to the cat , that if it were capable of explaining it would , but the toxoplasma gondii is in control . and the cat kills the rat according to the toxoplasma gondii plan , so it can reproduce in the feline digestive tract . grasshoppers infested with spinochordodes tellinii must individually conclude it s sensible to jump into water , but it s the worm s plan , in order to burst forth from out the drowning grasshopper and swim away . and ants taken over by ophiocordyceps unilateralis believe , in whatever capacity ants believe a thing , that they are deciding to ascend to the top of the stalk , but it is only so the parasite can have a nice place to spore out from within the ant . human hosts subject to parasitic behavior modification have eloquent rationale for upholding political principles and being fascist enslavers or obedient slaves to fascists , but the real reason people act dominant or submissive is totally biological , not political or logical . healthy people don t act like that . most of us are hosts , in a parasitic predicament more elaborate than that of the rat , the cat and toxoplasma gondii . toxoplasma gondii does infect people and has been known to make old ladies snap and lure young children to play catch in traffic . it can however only reproduce in felines and because of this , it s theorized , it tricks its host that is not a cat , to lose its most primal fears , so the host kills itself , so it can get out of the dead thing and hopefully into a cat . in the case of the rat their primal fear is the scent of feline urine , the cat and sure death . people infected with toxoplasma gondii frequently take part in risky and destructive behavior and maybe rationalize it s for adrenaline or adventure , but in reality it s so that they die and the parasite is released , all according to the parasite s plan . humans , sheep , bovines or whatever else becomes host to toxoplasma gondii are all affected in one way or another . fungal dependent parasites , like toxoplasma gondii and the fungal dependent human flukes , increase the production of testosterone as well as removing instinctual fears . bacterially infected hosts are drawn to that testosterone , in submission . the human flukes are dependent on primates to reproduce , only unlike toxoplasma gondii they remain within their hosts indefinitely , they don t need to leave and when one dies , another takes its place . the parasitic predicament , this dis - symbiosis of man , comes together in a way more intricate than perhaps any other similar system on the planet , of parasite with host , parasite with complimenting fungi or bacteria , the afflicted hosts acting out parasitic impulses among collectives with one aggressive group and another passive group in modified interaction , and finally the occult groups , parasitic themselves through fostering the parasites among the majority and restricting the cure in order to control the infected collective . as dropouts in a war world of infected and afflicted we have limited medical education and do not know every specific of the parasite s lifecycle . however the important things to know are that through it people are subjugated to do and accept corrupt inhuman evils and most importantly ; the cure is marijuana . exposure to fecal matter is the most common mode of transmission , mostly through the consumption of undercooked flesh it is theorized , though contact with a human host is possible mode of transmission . the specifics of the mode of transmission and how they reproduce is unknown and inconsequential . avoiding or at least charring meat is recommended . but the most important things to remember are the parasites make people unreasonably aggressive or inhumanly passive , the occult foster the parasitic predicament and the most practical cure is marijuana . marijuana literally frees your mind . the parasites are everywhere and yet there is a threat to mankind greater than the parasitic predicament . the most affronting threat pertains to global environmental destruction . the destruction is everywhere , worst though , in our fragile atmosphere . the sun used to be a mellow golden color and now it appears whiter due to radioactive particulate causing atmospheric breakdown . atmospheric turbulence , global warming and drought are all caused by the inability of the atmosphere to release heat due to congestion of radioactive particulate . the global military industrial complex began a geoengineering or restoration experiment in 1999 . the degradation of the atmosphere is in part the result of the expulsion of chemicals and gasses , but primarily is due to saturation of radioactive particulate . the wave emitting particulate is at the root of atmospheric destruction , now notable in the appearance of the sun . the geoengineering project injects negatively charged particulate into the atmosphere to attract the positively charged radioactive particulate which then potentially begins to fall out of the atmosphere . the injection of particulate to reduce the problem of the atmospheric radioactivity limits access to vitamin d , as well as doses everything with radioactive fallout . lacking vitamin d degrades our immune systems making us more susceptible to sickness , including parasitic behavior modification . the operation to fortify the atmosphere with negatively charged particulate is the final act to salvage the unsustainable nuclear experiment and the wave emitting particulate destroying our atmosphere . instead of announcement on the atmospheric degradation and change , the military industrial complex instituted the secret program to counteract the degradation . the secret of the parasitic predicament and the occult who foster is almost laughable compared to the secrets the colonel was burdened with , beginning with the radioactive atmospheric degradation . the degradation of the atmosphere is just one threat brought on by nuclear experimentation . thermonuclear war of course is another . but the real story of nuclear experimentation , the real , most immediate resulting threat , has never been revealed publicly , until now . in the beginning , the u . s . a . gathered together some of the wildest scientific minds in history and eventually set off the first nuclear detonation in new mexico , july 1 , 1945 . then two more bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki , japan . world war was won and world history was forever altered . the experiment was so dangerous , the forces so outrageous that the scientists debated on whether or not the first detonation would set off a chain reaction igniting the atmosphere , killing all life on earth . of course they went ahead anyway . the first detonation did not start a chain reaction setting the atmosphere afire . it did however start a chain reaction that began the atmospheric degradation we see today . it also set off another more dangerous chain reaction involving subjects very much beyond the pale of our traditional comprehension . the first nuclear detonation occurred in the new mexico desert valley accurately named the jornada del muerte , meaning the route of the dead man . the code name for the test was trinity and the bomb itself was known as the gadget . in july , 1945 we all began the journey of death - in secret . and on august 6 and 9 , the most horrific nuclear experiments imaginable took place , the bombings of the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki . then the whole world knew of the journada del muerte . a few people survived both bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki , having gone from one city to escape the other . around 70 , 000 human spirits were instantly vanquished in hiroshima and nearly that many in nagasaki , though it s impossible to know an exact figure , for most people were disappeared , atomized . many more hundreds of thousands died from burns , injuries and cancers after the bombings . july 16 , 1945 is a date that will live in infamy . it is the day everything changed , when pandora s box was pried open and humanity set forth on the journey of the dead man and the vaporizing of cities in august showed using pandora in the worst way imaginable . incidentally , there was a box set next to the trinity detonation which supposedly contained a living being of some sort for a top secret experiment . some say there was a demon inside it . others say the explosion itself released the demon . the official story states the box contained sensitive testing equipment . there is no denying the demon that is nuclear , but the literal demonic release is an unsubstantiated rumor . it was called the demon core and was purposefully mixed up with an accident - prone piece of plutonium also called the demon core . the same name supposedly covered up the actual demonic experiment . what is certain is that nuclear experimentation began in a stew of secrets , lies , omissions , whispers , rumors and silenced science , the devil s favorite tools . july , 16 , 1945 initiated the nuclear experimentation era , the total war on terra . since then thousands of nuclear detonations have occurred ; in the atmosphere , on the ground , underground and in the ocean . each one of the detonations started chain reactions of entropy we are only beginning to understand . now hundreds of nuclear experiment reactors around the world boil water for electricity , with adjacent fuel pools , each requiring constant attention , each so poisonous , just one is capable of altering or destroying entirety . the waste is so dangerous it can only be made into weaponry , or buried , or blasted off to jupiter , or put somewhere requiring attention for the next ten thousand generations . tons of depleted uranium has been exploded and an unknown tonnage of radioactive waste is now enveloping the planet from releases and routine accidents . nuclear experimentation is a war on terra , a war on life itself . j . robert oppenheimer was the most prominent scientist to work on the manhattan project to create the gadget . oppenheimer opened pandora s box . coincidentally his last name , from a region in germany , eerily means open home . he opened the box and opened the door to our home . and not so incidentally , he was a friend of the rosenburgs , who gave nuclear technology to the soviets . he famously quoted a hindu parable after witnessing the fruition of his handiwork , we knew the world would not be the same . a few people laughed . a few people cried . most people were silent . i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavad gita . vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty . and to impress him takes on his multi - armed form and says , now i am become death , the destroyer of worlds . i suppose we all thought that . there is no going back to pre - pandora earth . japan surrendered and the u . s . a . was proudly the world s first super power . the detonations on hiroshima and nagasaki got the attention of the world . ironically though , the top secret detonation in new mexico got the attention of others , elsewhere . nuclear detonations create a unique electromagnetic pulse of metaphysical destruction . there is the notable explosion , the electromagnetic pulse , the poisonous radioactive fallout and the detrimental atmospheric chain reactions due to introduction of the wave emitting particles , the lingering entropy and also , according to colonel ryan j . arlington , there are extra - dimensional reactions . the detonations crack the space - time continuum . the detonation from the explosion in new mexico sent a destructive and unique ping rippling across space , notifying the universe that a nuclear detonation occurred . each subsequent detonation was another pulse sent across the vibrational sea of the universe which said , we re over here and we re stupid enough to light off nukes . the pings got the attention of all interstellar life in the universe . extraterrestrial beings soon arrived to earth to investigate the nuclear detonations in our remote corner of the universe . some were aware we were here prior and some only learned who it was and where we were through the nuclear pings . the federation of bipedals were aware of earthlings before the pings . and soon enough federation representation contacted earthen leadership , but unbeknownst to the federation , a rogue extraterrestrial race outside the federation had clandestinely arrived to earth before them . july 16 , 1945 was the beginning of modern times and on july 17 postmodern decay began . the federation s immediate concern was to cease nuclear experimentation to protect the spirits of mouse and man alike from the detonations . they informed the leadership that beings killed in such detonations are not just killed , their spirit is obliterated , permanently dematerialized . the detonations physically destroy beings and places , crack the space - time continuum and incinerate spirits , the most ungodly act a being can do . the federation revealed the true scope of the detonations and the existence of spirit within all living beings . they further revealed the existence of god which is said to have greatly upset the politicians . the federation provided a myriad of reasons to discontinue nuclear experimentation , chief among being the destruction of the very ethereal essence . they informed the earthen leadership that the myth of pandora s box is about nuclear experimentation . and that nuclear experimentation would result in federation ostracism , generational biological degradation and inevitable extinction . the federation knew about our legend of pandora s box , they knew our languages and cultures and mythology . they knew the whole human story , every legend and every myth . they didn t know about the last seven hundred years , but they knew our history . the federation arrived in july , 1952 , by then 37 detonations had taken place . they went straight to washington d . c . and their visits that summer made national headlines . videos , photographs and reports of their visits to washington d . c . in 1952 , number in the thousands . president harry truman himself addressed and denied the public questioning concerning extraterrestrials landing on the white house lawn . the federation revealed information on the catastrophic results of opening pandora s box and the history of humankind , which was much like our history on earth , dotted by wars and regrettable acts . the heavily redacted history revealed that there was once a great war between bipedals in the andromeda system over a magical mineral . the rejuvenating mineral compound was thought to be in limited supply . and beings risked their existence for it . after realization there was plenty of the mineral , the war ended . it was found humans instigated the conflict and hid where the mineral could be found in abundance , solely because we didn t want a specific race to have the mineral . the newly formed federation debated on the extermination of mankind for starting the war , but instead they genetically altered our mental capacity and banished humans to remote prison planets . the reason people only use seven percent of our brain capacity is because of the genetically implemented mental deformity . supposedly when humans first arrived to prison earth people quarried stones and erected structures with simplistic devices powered by electromagnetics and the mind . telekinesis and free energy technology were considered simple among bipedals without the genetic mental hindrance . free energy technology supposedly utilizes the electromagnetic higgs boson counter - wave to manipulate and transform gravity and electromagnetism through consciousness . subatomic particles behave as waves , only a very few , actually have weight , they are known as higgs boson particles . the counter - wave can make the dense malleable and the heavy become light . generations after the implant we became incapable of understanding how to use the force . the federation informed the leadership that if we continued nuclear experimentation we would never be allowed free energy technology . originally it was assumed the federation meant it would restrict our access to free energy technology as a consequence , but the disruption of the space time continuum and electro - magnetosphere caused by nuclear experimentation is what prevents access to the unlimited energy through the otherwise smooth space - time continuum . nuclear experimentation disrupts the space - time continuum in a way that makes the counter - wave inaccessible . free energy is near impossible to access due to the present electromagnetic conditions . there are other planets of mentally deformed humans , but only we have conducted nuclear experimentation . in fact , only a few other species in the whole universe have ever transformed their planet into a nuclear experiment and their fate is ours , deformity and extinction . no one in the universe is considered as stupid and violent as earthlings . and at the same time , human humor is universally renowned . even today , despite our deformity , our jokes are still considered some of the finest entertainment known . beings travel light years just to watch us . harry truman , in true manly fashion , did not trust the federation . after all , the aliens were critical of nuclear experimentation and the obliteration of japanese cities , the very act that made the u . s . a . the world s super power . the federation insisted they cease nuclear experimentation and make peace on earth . in exchange they would offer membership into the federation . harry truman took this to be a sly plot and after winning world war ii no one in the universe was going to tell the united states to disarm . harry truman didn t believe them , not after what happened in roswell and elsewhere . the federation insisted if there was peace on earth , if nuclear experimentation was ceased , they would provide free energy technology , interplanetary travel technology and planetary defense from rogue races . the federation did not know that one of those rogue races was already here . the race we know as the greys were the first to detect the atomic ping from earth and the first to arrive here . the earthen leadership was suspicious of the federation because of their experiences with the greys . the greys possess all the technology the federation does , but operate outside federation law . when it comes to detection of nuclear experimentation the greys possess technology superior to that of federation . in fact , there is no race which understands nuclear experimentation better than the greys and consequently no race more negatively altered by it . the greys learned about nuclear experimentation in the universe and in the process destroyed their home planet and their genetic viability . they were a dying race . the greys completed their journey to earth in 1947 . a scout ship crashed in roswell , new mexico that summer , a hop skip and jump away from the trinity test site . the crash landing ended in the first confrontation . the events at roswell and other provocative actions made harry truman distrust the federation mistaking them for greys . the greys were aware of our history , but only learned of our location when we pinged the cosmos . the greys were banished from the federation for opening pandora s box thousands of years ago . ultimately they had to evacuate their home planet because of failed nuclear experimentation . the greys are highly intelligent , but their ardent theology states they are god s chosen bipedal and because of this they believed they could not be harmed by nuclear experimentation . the greys were a dying race and been traversing the universe seeking an unclaimed and habitable planet with dna and rna of a suitable race to use to reconstitute their genetic viability . the gadget went off just in time for them to find us , a whole planet of near unaltered genetics . after the greys became aware of the federation they made their own introduction and deals in order to subvert the federation . in exchange for technology , not including free energy or interplanetary travel technology , the greys were harvested dna and rna . many of the missing persons of the world were kidnapped by greys . eventually the federation became aware of the greys and informed the earth governments of the trickery . the greys subverted the efforts of the federation to stop nuclear experimentation , because they want to destroy us . they wanted our genes , and now they want earth . and if humans are no longer genetically viable , under federation law , the greys can have earth . and the quickest way to eliminate our genetic viability is through nuclear experimentation . earth powers continued nuclear experimentation , believing we were tapping into the power of the sun . the greys just wait for nuclear experimentation to eliminate our biological viability , at which time , the federation would consider the prison planet a failure , whereupon they would no longer be responsible and the greys could takeover . the greys have infiltrated society and transformed nuclear experimentation into what it is today , a way to kill us . the madness of nuclear experimentation has exposed us to a mad , mad universe . the policy shared by the nuclear powers toward deterrence of war is just one aspect of the madness . this policy is known as mad , mutually assured destruction . it s the idea that war is deterred through the threat of total destruction . the greys agenda is to kill earthlings and begin infiltrated the upper echelons of every relevant institution by about 1952 . since then they ve been pushing nuclear experimentation , so we kill ourselves and the federation leaves earth to them . the greys have hybrids , grey skinned near humans who might only be a few years old , but appear as if octogenarians . they are extremely intelligent , but lack emotion and any sense of humor . they typically are named abbot , moe , beaver , curly or another name they picked up from 1950 s americana . the federation is monitoring the situation . they visit nuclear experimentation facilities , routinely shutting down missile systems and taking out launched , unarmed icbms with their ships like collies tracking down frisbees , but otherwise they are waiting . colonel ryan j . arlington watched a federation ship he would later learn , zap a missile facility and disable the guidance systems of multiple missiles , three nights in a row . the federation can legally do no more than monitor and test . they cannot force their will on prisoners and they have to protect the prisoners - until they are no longer genetically viable . they are also obligated to prevent nuclear experimentation throughout the universe so as to preserve spirit and assure the space - time continuum doesn t crack apart resulting in an excruciating painful implosion of the universe or big ping , resulting in another big bang . the federation is capable of disabling missiles from and destroying them after they are launched , but even the federation can t cease the ongoing reactions at nuclear power generation experiments . the federation legal conundrum has resulted in a waiting game . the federation considered freeing us from our genetically implemented binds , but we were distrustful and conniving and we couldn t stop nuclear experimentation , unconsciously believing that perhaps , we too , were so liked by god , that we could defy the consequences of nuclear experimentation . earth could have been the first human planet allowed into the federation , we could have been a human voice , but we proved unready . the greys reached our solar system a dying race . they disappeared thousands of people and utilized our genetics to revitalize their altered chromosomes . and now they want earth . the federation is stuck in a legal conundrum unable to assist us , unable to force us to cease nuclear experimentation and required to prevent detonations . we ve been invaded . practically every major institution has been compromised to some extent , the nuclear experimentation industry has been almost totally compromised by the hybrids , for many institutions can control us , but nuclear experimentation can kill us . the nuclear experimentation industry is saturated with grey hybrids so they can set up our mad . the best way for the greys to cease humanity s biological success is to release radioactive particulate . all they have to do is promote nuclear experimentation and make sure people we it to continue , for eventually it will fail and they will win earth . the nuclear experiment makes nothing as it was . rising cancer rates were the first sign of nuclear experimentation gone awry . next will be declining birth rates . tobacco was at one time safe when used in moderation . it was sacred to the american indians and beneficial when smoked with sage as they did . now tobacco grown outside is dusted with so many radioactive particles , it s deadly to smoke , part of an out of control experiment , a pandora . nuclear experimentation has degraded all life since 1945 , producing such persistent toxins as to be cancerous forever and make future generations less intelligent , less attractive and less biologically successful . its waste is cancerous , negatively alters genetics and some of it , like krypton 85 result in dramatic drought . radioactive particles emit heat for thousands of years and are now dispersed globally in all strata reducing the atmosphere s ability to release heat , increasing holes in the ozone and the new norm of powerful storms . the secrets concerning the increase in cancer , decline in birthrates , global warming , drought , the parasitic predicament and the occult who cultivate it , our shackled mental capacity , the fact underground bases exist all over the world partly as contingency plans in case of nuclear devastation are all insignificant next to the takeover . it is humans versus greys . and the only way to win is to cease nuclear experimentation . and the only way to do that is to become conscious of the problem . the only way to become conscious at all is by eliminating the parasites by smoking copious amounts of marijuana , preferably marijuana grown indoors to minimalize ingestion of radioactive particulate . only when we cease nuclear experimentation will the federation consider siding with humanity . and only when we cease nuclear experimentation will the greys leave . until nuclear experimentation ceases , until marijuana is freely distributed , we will take action to shut down all nuclear experimentation . if nuclear experimentation is not ceased there will be another hiroshima and there will be another fukushima . the likelihood of multiple nuclear experiment failures is low , currently . however colonel ryan j . arlington is privy to information on a huge massive object or hmo . the hmo is expected to careen through the solar system and when it does the object may cause the oceans to rise variously by twenty feet or more , which would be minor all things considered , except for the nuclear power plants on the coasts . the hmo could also cause a solar flare on a scale that might burn half the planet and set off a series strong earthquakes . the hmo is bound to cause calamity and yet it only takes a minute act of god to result in nuclear catastrophe . if the sea level rises just five feet , savage nuclear industrial death is possible . even if the hmo only causes sporadic flooding and earthquakes failure of nuclear experimentation is practically guaranteed . stop nuclear experimentation or we will stop it . stop all nuclear experimentation or it will stop us all . ours , colonel ryan j . arlington and prince ephraim gregory nicholas romanov rasputin moscovitch from currently free ebook ethan indigo smith s controversial book , the terraist letters , humorously contrasts the very serious issues of global nuclear experimentation and global marijuana prohibition . it is a funny and provocative political satire that attempts to brings some sanity to the most serious subject matter of nuclear experimentation , in a way that only ethan can . ethan s work will titillate , irritate , but most importantly , stimulate some serious thought concerning current conventions . give it a read . your brain might thank you . new york times best selling author , jim marrs the complete patriot s guide ethan indigo

clancy overell editor contact a local upf member has today declared that aboriginal people should be thankful for white people did to them , while also stating that he can t be held accountable for what white people did to them . kai blottrell ( 32 ) a local car detailer who made heaps of coin during the pink batts fiasco , says that he doesn t know much about his family tree given his estranged relationship with his father and general disinterest in his mother but he presumes his family arrived in the first fleet . this wild guess at his family s heritage makes him one of the most australian people there is , and he won t be made to feel ashamed about that . however , as january 26 th approaches , kai is forced to confront the national dialogue currently surrounding the idea of celebrating the end of indigenous sovereignty , and the unfair treatment of first australians that followed his ancestor s supposed arrival . i wasn t there he says . i had nothing to do with it . why should i be made to feel bad about the atrocities they committed . however , while kai grapples with the well - documented attempts at genocide and forced assimilation , he also can t help but defend them . my ancestors didn t steal australia , they created it he says , while contemplating whether or not he can continue with this new angle . and my family didn t immigrate into an existing country , they built one even if they still don t have their own head of state and still answer to the queen as kai begins to lose his temper , the deep sadness inside his heart lifts slightly which inevitably leads him to undermine every other coherent argument he has made throughout his entire tirade . they should be thankful he says with a tear welling in his eyes , as he ponders on how long it has taken his dad to buy a packet of smokes .
errol parker editor - at - large contact another eventless evening drew to a close at the dolphins leagues club at 10 pm last night . roger dunston rang the bell for last drinks , locked the pokies , took the tills and told the barman to get them all out by 10 : 30 . it s not the 24 - year - old s first rodeo and it certainly won t be his last . but until his ship comes in and his dreams begin to take shape , it s all the unpopular hotel manager has to hold on to . bidding the bar staff goodbye as they necked the rest of their staffies , the last d45 bus to the french quarter gargled up the hill toward the club . you can often hear the bus before you see it , especially late a night , he said . but yeah , last night wasn t like any other . it was just another tuesday being underemployed working in hospitality , i guess . as the clock struck midnight , he counted the safe to find that it was almost exactly 2000 down for the day . he counted the tills again . after an hour of investigation , he discovered a large pokie payout around lunchtime that the day manager neglected to write up on the office whiteboard . it was almost 2000 . relieved , he locked up sent a passive - aggressive email to the other managers and the owner regarding the importance of using the fucking whiteboard . it was then , when he d finally stopped moving and thinking for the day , that he realised he hadn t eaten since lunch . so on the drive home , he stopped at the busy bee service station on the old city district limits and went inside to peruse the limited takeaway menu . not pies in the hotbox , not even a shepherds . his hunger was too much for a packet of ccs or a maxibon . he toyed with the idea of having a chocolate moove . young roger made his choice , paid for it in silver coins he scraped out of his Xf falcon s never - used ashtray and pulled into the servo s parking area away from the pumps to have his dinner . in the end , i went with an egg and lettuce sandwich from the fridge . i wanted something hot but you can t have a win every day , look , it is what it is . the sandwich wasn t great . if i were a gambling man , i would ve bet on those eggs in the sandwich being laid in about october last year . the bread was soggy and impregnated with egg juice . but it succeeded in making me not hungry so whatever . if i don t get sick from it , i ll have another one , he looked up at the moon and thought about the day when he wouldn t have to live this life anymore . turns out there s not too much career work on at the moment , especially when you ve got an arts degree in history and art criticism , at least i ve got a home and a bed . it could be worse ; way , way , way worse , but at the same time , things could be so , so much better than they are now . more to come .
clancy overell editor contact the owners of a visually displeasing house in betoota s old meatworkers district have been praised by local council for keeping the building just as ugly as it was when it was built in the 1940 s . situated at number 3 daroo street , the house has had only three owners since it first began violating the eyes of the locals , and has retained it s same californian - style sky - blue colour for the entire duration . despite even the owners themselves admitting that the architecture hasn t aged well , they refuse to alter it in any way at the advice of a few smug local art and design historians . yeah says the owner . it s art deco art deco , sometimes referred to as deco , is a style of visual arts , architecture and design that first appeared in france just before world war i . art deco influenced the design of buildings , furniture , jewellery , fashion , cars , movie theatres , trains , ocean liners , and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners . it took its name , short for arts d coratifs , from the exposition internationale des arts d coratifs et industriels modernes held in paris in 1925 . it is this particular style that has millions of inner - suburban streets around australia fall victim to the circular concrete facades and tall baptist church - style windows made popular between the world wars . it combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials . during its heyday , art deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress nowadays the term is generally used to excuse ugly buildings that are being assessed for a heritage listing .

errol parker editor - at - large contact as per local government law , a glassing at a popular betoota grove gastropub has resulted in the venue being forced to serve drinks in plastic glassware for the foreseeable future . the docking sailors , which ambiguously states it was founded in 1899 despite being a tasteless renovation of the former venue , played host to a vicious and cowardly attack earlier this year that saw a man receive close to 90 internal and external stitches . as the case is before the courts and the names suppressed , the advocate can only state that an interim ban has been placed on all glassware in the venue while officials investigate what happened . which means the upper crust of the town s population now has to enjoy a cool , refreshing 9 schooner of diamantina pale ale out of a scuffed plastic glass . over lunch , local hedge fund manager and gun owner bruce hall said his experience at the venue was marred by the offensive and tacky glassware . you go in there and order the 39 sirloin , they hand you back a buzzer and a flat beer in a plastic schooner glass , he said . and asIc think we re the criminals . honestly , if one fired - up piss head with anger problems can fuck a good pub like the docking , then we ve devolved as a fucking species , but yeah , back to what you were saying . when you walk into a pub and they ve got plastic glassware , it s a pretty good indication some shit has gone down here and some poor cunt has been glassed . people who glass people should be hanged from the streetlamps and their organs given to the needy . bruce stopped to catch his breath after that explosive rant , which gave enough time for our reporter to slip out the discreet VIp room exit . more to come .

decades ago , when an individual claimed to work at a military facility that required top level security clearance and spoke about classified military secrets and technology , they were ridiculed . this is why , in some cases , they were allowed to speak and share sensitive information , because most of it was so unbelievable and easy to ridicule that , instead of the world of secrecy retaliating , they let these individuals speak their mind . in the past , individuals blowing the whistle , regardless of whether or not their backgrounds could be verifiable , was something that didn t happen as much as it happens today . take for example , the hundreds of high ranking ex - military and political personnel sharing their experiences with ufos . today , ufos are official , as the pentagon recently released a video of an object performing maneuvers no known aircraft can . the topic is also becoming popular within academia , as a number of peer - reviewed research articles have also emerged hinting strongly to artificial surface interventions on other bodies within our solar system , like the moon and mars , for example . who is the man in the video below it s bob lazar , the one who blew the lid open on places like area 51 , a secret military base that s been used to test advanced military air - craft , and supposedly other things . it s existence was officially disclosed by the us government a few years ago , but it s important to note here that there are multiple military bases located throughout the us , some even more secretive than area 51 and some are even located beneath the ocean floor . for more detailed information on that topic , you can refer to the two articles linked below that we ve published on the subject . under ocean military bases : there is more than just one area 51 see for yourself right beneath your feet the hidden reality of deep underground military bases who is bob lazar decades ago , bob lazar hit the mainstream and became quite popular after claiming to have worked on reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology at a site called s - 4 , near the area 51 facility . he s also mentioned information about extraterrestrials and the fact that there are multiple groups , some of which have been in contact with several global governments . related ce articles : have governments actually been revere engineering extraterrestrial technology everything is in a process of investigation both in the united states and in spain , as well as the rest of the world . the nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the ufo phenomenon . there is an international exchange of data . general carlos castro cavero ( 1979 ) . he also claims to have been in contact with edward teller , a hungarian - american theoretical physicist , known as the father of the hydrogen bomb . on a side note , individuals of teller s stature have long been speaking up about the ufo issue . take one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry , hermann oberth , who stated that : it is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system . i think that they possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries . ( source ) according to lazar , he met teller at a conference and had a brief discussion with him . lazar sent him a resume inquiring about a job . lazar said that , dr teller responded by telephone and told me that he was no longer active , but just functioned in a consultant capacity . he gave me the name of a contact to call in las vegas , i made that call and things progressed from there . when teller was asked on camera if he knew bob lazar , he refused to answer and said if asked again , he will sit silently . you can see a clip of that segment near the end of this video . today , it s much easier to take lazar seriously , given all of the information that s emerged corroborating his story and the fact that his story hasn t changed one bit since he began speaking . related ce article : it s official we now know that ufos or uap are real , so are they extraterrestrial or not here s one of lazar s most recent interviews . lazar currently runs a business called united nuclear , where he maintains the availability of scientific equipment , supplies chemicals to the general public , experimenters , and learning institutions . they make basic scientific supplies as well as difficult to find , rare unusual science - related products available to the hobbyist , teacher , experimenter , and professional organizations . below is a video of him showing off his water powered car . as he says , you can t really use water for fuel but , you use water as the source material , you run electricity through it and it breaks it down into hydrogen and oxygen and then you can burn the hydrogen . related ce article : the inventor of a water powered car that died in a restaurant yelling they poisoned me . to read our most recent and archived articles on the ufo / extraterrestrial phenomenon , you can click here . there are no shortage of interviews regarding the topic of ufos with lazar , all it takes is a quick google / youtube search and you ll be able to find more .

ever wonder what s on the mind of today s most notable people well , don t miss our unbelievable roundup of the best and most talked about quotes of the day :
hey , you re here , you made it congratulations on making it this far . i m assuming the majority of people who saw this post only read the headline and then formed an opinion . it s okay of course , everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but i m here to offer you another perspective on this story . sure , fast food restaurants and major corporations tend to have only one thing in mind , money . hence the phrase that is often used to describe corporations ; put profit before the people and the environment . in most cases , this is true , but , should we remain jaded to even the victories from these corporations or should we celebrate these successes , remain hopeful and keep on keeping on by voting with our dollar you see , as the consumer , whether you are aware of it or not you have a direct say in the business practices of these corporations , and that say comes from where you decide to spend your dollar and if you really choose to put your money where your mouth is . what are they changing mcdonald s has now announced a definite timeline to its goal of completely eliminating plastic and foam cups from their restaurants . by the end of the year , every soft drink holder will be made with a packaging made from fiber or certified recycled material . this same design will incorporate all of the packaging in use from the brand by 2020 , according to their website . starbucks is taking similar action in the u . k . this february , customers will be charged about 7 cents for each paper cup in 20 to 25 stores in central london with the hopes of motivating the customers to choose reusable mugs instead . the money raised from the cup fee will be donated to an environmental charity and behaviour analyst , hubbub , who is dedicated to investigating how the public can be encouraged to choose reusable drink containers . another incentive given from the company is a discount of 34 cents to those who do bring a reusable cup of their own , which will encourage those who frequent starbucks to bring their own mugs we can only hope that these reusable mugs are made from sustainable materials . evolve your inbox stay conscious daily inspiration and all our best content , straight to your inbox . but i don t eat at mcdonald s or starbucks sure , many of you probably don t eat at mcdonald s or starbucks because of their unsustainable business practices and unhealthy food and drink options , good for you but , guess what this is exactly what has caused these two major corporations to make this type of change . yes , they still want your money and they are still , most likely , all about profit before people , but because they have lost the revenue from consumers like you , they are scrambling and trying to find a way to continue making tons of money . they know that in this day and age , many people are waking up to the fact that we can no longer continue doing things in the same old fashion if we want to have a chance at saving our environment . so , with this awareness , they might think something along the lines of , hey , if we stopped using foam and encouraged reusable cups , maybe we could gain back some of those lost customers and get our profits back up . and you know what they probably will . because this type of thing is very important to some people and for good reason . however , if some of us continue to boycott such establishments , they may start serving soda sweetened with xylitol , or switch the oil they use to cook their fries , perhaps they may switch to hormone and antibiotic free meat products . the bottom line is that they will do whatever it takes to stay in business , a great example is the launch of their recent vegan burger to appeal to a larger consumer base . but the irony here is that as we continue to wake up and do our part for our environment , the animals , planet and ourselves , these establishments will cease to exist . at least on their way out , and that s because they are making the changes that we need to see big corporations make in order to truly change the way we are currently doing things here on planet earth . as awareness increases , so do these changes . they go hand in hand . so , just because they are doing something positive , does that mean that we should go and spend our money there not necessarily , but should we celebrate even these small successes absolutely . one step at a time and these times , are indeed changing . let s remain hopeful , because the opposite is projecting the negative , the lack , the destruction and with that kind of energy how can we expect anything to really change

islamic nations again dominate list of ' countries where it is most dangerous to follow jesus ' january 22 , 2018 eight of the ten countries where christians face the worst persecution are islamic nations , according to open doors usa ' s 2018 " world watch list , " which attributes the maltreatment to " islamic oppression . " and of the top 50 " countries where it is most dangerous to follow jesus " in this year ' s report , no fewer than 36 are members of the organization of islamic cooperation ( oic ) , the bloc of muslim - majority states . the advocacy organization reports that 215 million christians - one in 12 worldwide - experience high levels of persecution . during the reporting period for the 2018 list , it says , 3 , 066 christians were killed , 1 , 252 were abducted , 1 , 020 were raped or sexually harassed , and 793 churches were attacked . the two non - islamic states among the ten worst persecutors of christians in the latest report are north korea - the stalinist regime has topped the list every year since 2002 and does so again this year ; and eritrea , an authoritarian dictatorship that has ranked in the top ten since 2015 , and is in sixth place this year . the eight islamic nations in the top ten are , in order of severity of the persecution , afghanistan , somalia , sudan , pakistan , libya , iraq , yemen and iran . taking places 11 to 20 are india , saudi arabia , maldives , nigeria , syria , uzbekistan , egypt , vietnam , turkmenistan and laos . all are oic members bar india ( a hindu - majority nation with a large muslim minority ) , and communist - ruled vietnam and laos . syria has dropped out of the top ten for the first time in five years . in 2014 , open doors ranked it as the third - worst persecutor of christians . among islamic states where persecution of christians is rife are countries deemed to be important u . s . allies , such as afghanistan ( 2 ) , pakistan ( 5 ) , iraq ( 8 ) , saudi arabia ( 12 ) , egypt ( 17 ) , jordan ( 21 ) , qatar ( 27 ) and turkey ( 31 ) . the world watch list report scores countries on a scale of 0 to 100 points ( with 100 characterizing the greatest degree of persecution ) , based on a research process that draws from data from field workers and external experts and includes " questions covering five spheres of life and the prevalence of violent incidents . " the five spheres are church life , national life , community life , family life and private life . the worst persecutor this year , north korea , scored 96 points , while the next nine ranged from 93 for afghanistan to 85 for iran . islamic countries account for well below one - third of the total number of countries in the world . yet they have dominated the top ten of the open doors ' annual list of christian persecutors every year for more than a decade . ( graph : cnsnews . com / data : open doors usa ) back in 2004 , only four of the top ten countries were islamic . ( the six non - islamic countries on that year ' s list were north korea , laos , vietnam , bhutan , burma and china . ) the number of muslim states among the top ten then rose steadily - to five in 2005 and 2006 , to six in 2007 and 2008 , to seven in 2009 . every year since 2010 , either eight or nine of the ten countries listed have been islamic . islamic oppression ' apart from the consistently list - topping north korea , other countries which have perennially featured among the top worst persecutors of christians in open doors ' reckoning include : - - iran , which has made the report ' s top ten every year since 2004 , reaching as high as second place in 2010 and 2011 . - - afghanistan , which has made the top ten every year since 2007 , reaching second place in 2012 and again in 2018 . - - somalia , which has been among the top ten every year since 2009 , reaching the position of the world ' s second - worst persecutor in 2014 , 2015 and again in 2017 . - - iraq , which has made the top ten every year since 2011 , reaching second place in 2016 . - - pakistan , which has been in the top ten every year since 2014 , reaching as high as fourth place in 2017 . the trump administration this month for the first time placed pakistan on a " special watch list " for religious freedom violations , but stopped short of assigning the more weighty " country of particular concern " ( cpc ) designation . the ten currently - designated cpcs are burma , china , eritrea , iran , north korea , sudan , saudi arabia , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan . those ten countries all feature on the open doors list - which focuses on persecution of christians specifically , rather than religious freedom violations in general - ranging in position from 1 st ( north korea ) to 43 rd ( china ) . major trends in christian persecution identified by open doors this year include the rise of religious nationalism , seen especially in countries like india and burma ; and intense persecution in former soviet central asian republics , coming both from nationalist pro - islamic governments and from societies where islam is reviving . the spread of radical islam is a particularly key factor . " islamic oppression is one of the most widely recognized sources of persecution for christians in the world today - and it continues to spread - aiming to bring many parts of the world under shari ' a law , " the report says . " the movement , which often results in islamic militancy and persecution of christians , is expanding in asia ( philippines , bangladesh , indonesia ) and africa ( egypt , nigeria , somalia ) .

many dog owners know not to toss a turkey or chicken bone to their dog ; those bones are just too brittle . but the u . s . food and drug administration ( fda ) says the risk goes beyond that , especially when it comes to the bone treats you may see at the store . what s a bone treat fda has received about 68 reports of pet illnesses related to bone treats , which differ from uncooked butcher - type bones because they are processed and packaged for sale as dog treats . a variety of commercially - available bone treats for dogs including treats described as ham bones , pork femur bones , rib bones , and smokey knuckle bones were listed in the reports . the products may be dried through a smoking process or by baking , and may contain other ingredients such as preservatives , seasonings , and smoke flavorings . so if you re planning to give your dog a stocking full of bone treats this holiday season , you may want to reconsider . according to carmela stamper , a veterinarian in the center for veterinary medicine ( cvm ) at the fda , giving your dog a bone treat might lead to an unexpected trip to your veterinarian , a possible emergency surgery , or even death for your pet . illnesses reported illnesses reported to fda by owners and veterinarians in dogs that have eaten bone treats have included : gastrointestinal obstruction ( blockage in the digestive tract ) choking cuts and wounds in the mouth or on the tonsils vomiting diarrhea bleeding from the rectum , and / or death . approximately fifteen dogs reportedly died after eating a bone treat . the reports , sent in by pet owners and veterinarians , involved about 90 dogs ( some reports included more than one dog ) . in addition , fda received seven reports of product problems , such as moldy - appearing bones , or bone treats splintering when chewed by the pet . tips to keep your dog safe here are some tips to keep your dog safe : chicken bones and other bones from the kitchen table can cause injury when chewed by pets , too . so be careful to keep platters out of reach when you re cooking or the family is eating . be careful what you put in the trash can . dogs are notorious for helping themselves to the turkey carcass or steak bones disposed of there . talk with your veterinarian about other toys or treats that are most appropriate for your dog . there are many available products made with different materials for dogs to chew on . we recommend supervising your dog with any chew toy or treat , especially one she hasn t had before , adds stamper . and if she just isn t acting right , call your veterinarian right away

at - home mother . fifty shades of grey is a superb christian - romance novel series by american writer etta l . james . the book quickly developed a cult - like following , because it shows what it is like for a woman to date and marry a sterling christian man with republican values . women worldwide have come to realize the lifestyle , the thrills and excitement , that comes with marrying a man with a lofty moral compass , compassion for his woman and life and the capitalist blessings that god gives those of us who walk in his light . this weekend the movie has already surpassed the passion of christ , another great movie about a moral man giving all for those he loves . james first came up with the book s concept after reading stephanie meyer s twilight series . what if these characters were realistic and edward was a wealthy christian , she mused to herself . starting off with just a bit of penned fan fiction for the net , james realized she had written her biggest hit yet by the instant cult following her writings received . it was not before long that we got the first novel , then the latter two , that we will explore here and understand why the fifty shades of grey movie , just like most true republican men , is irresistible to women . fifty shades of grey starts out in seattle , where a college - literature student named anastasia gets to interview a handsome , well - built 27 - year - old billionaire venture capitalist named christian grey . when you read about christian grey , you immediately think about a young mitt romney . confident , republican , dominant and commanding the submissive : these are all admirable christian qualities that make women melt , as we find in this hit movie that s grossed 81 . 7 million in its opening weekend . christian grey is an avatar for a young mitt romney in this flick . james pick of the name christian grey and use of mitt romney for his inspiration is perfect . mitt romney has christian values , he is youthful but has those wise greying temples , which sends women stamping their hind legs like a cat in heat . stephanie meyers is mormon , so it makes sense that the source man for the book and movie follows that faith . but the plot quickly transcends into the world of christianity in james bent , when it explores the fundamental concept of republican virtues and values : wealth , strong sensuality for the eventual / wife and overcoming internal demons . hence the name christian grey . christian grey is a flawed man . a jezebel named mrs . robinson beguiled him when he was only 15 - year - old . at an age where he just wanted to focus on his studies and faith , an old cougar preyed on him and ruined his mind a bit . christian overcame his internal hurt by focusing on business and becoming successful , just like everyone else in his family . but christian still had that hole in his soul , put there by mrs . robinson . how many young men have had to suffer just that same fate , at the hands of some toned - up vixen on the prowl christian instantly realizes anastasia is going to be his wife , but is worried that she is only 21 - years - old . therefore he creates some clear lines for her , and this is where everything gets quite juicy and salacious . christian grey sets out an agenda , explaining to ana that there will be no romance , just a strict values - driven relationship . he will be the dominant man and she the submissive wife . it takes a while for anastasia to come to terms with this dynamic , but she slowly explores it and realizes the child - inducing sensations from following biblical edict and submitting to christian s authority . and it is the allure of this dynamic that makes fifty shades of grey have a 94 approval rating among women . there is a lie that satan has spread in our world : christian men are boring at home , especially when kicking the sheets . james proves the truth of the matter is definitely opposite . christian s core demand for ana is very simple : he wants her to learn something crucial being domestic stay - at - home mother . he cutely codes this as their secret anagram , that is her learning to bdsm . when she sees those letters or hears christian say he wants to further develop their bdsm , she blushes and her inner goddess cries out in pleasures , because she knows he is wanting to teach her to be a good , passionate wife who will bring their marriage years of pleasure . there is no reason for her to go out and work , since he is rich . christian just wants her to not do damaging things , like going out to get drunk with her old college - friends , not being seduced by just a friends like jose rodriguez , not being seduced by crazed - bosses like jack the ripper at sip and not being jealous of his ex - girlfriends . through a lot of grit and near -

mormonoclast writer orson scott card built a new home in the foothills of draper with explicit instructions to his builders to ensure there were no closets whatsoever in the house , no sir , not one . i mean , why would i want a closet , or need a closet i think far too much attention is given to closets and that which is held within the closet , so i don t want a closet , i don t need a closet , i can t stand the closet , said the firebrand author of the ender s game series . an anxious card looked around , then pointed toward recently - completed , parallel formica countertops and said , i m going to drop the a off these buggers , if you know what i mean . you know what i mean , right i m orson scott card . the new home is conservative in appearance , and with no closets it provides the southern virginia professor a chance to spatially use his creativity to see what he can cram into what outsiders might see as a normal home , but is in fact missing vital components upon closer inspection . trey stone , building the home for card , said , i m worried that mr . orson card isn t aware of the consequences of having no closets . sure , the majority of square feet in the home will be used as comfort rooms for him , but those small closets play a big role . i mean , how is he going to have a wardrobe surely the only way to dress nicely is by having a closet . without the closets , is it even a home it s more like , i dunno , a big it instead . the 1985 square - foot rambler honors the release year of his magnum opus ender s game , which won both hugo and nebula awards for the author , and was just released theatrically . he plans to use the home as a respite from the plush , humid landscapes of north carolina that he calls home . the dark secret of homeowning society the one that dares not speak its name is how many homeowners first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction of closets , and how many of them yearn to get out of the homeowners community and live normally , card said , followed by a series of heavy breaths . i m being forced to comply with way too many zoning ordinances . i also see out - of - work urban men working on my home , which is weird since they clearly look like out - of - work urban men . i can t say for certain that they are in obama s national police force , but i can t say for certain that they aren t in it , either . this is all really , really gay .
american fork s east 17 th ward s excitement erupted on monday afternoon , as word of an online petition spread like wildfire or scattered seed all over the face book feeds of the congregation s members . i knew i had to take a firm stand , so i put my name and zip code in the online form , and created a profile . it was so easy to access . i love when the internet can be used so easily ; i just type something into a box and have precisely what i m looking for show up and hope that the bandwidth isn t clogged . sometimes you have to drop it from 1080 p to 480 p for it to load . uh , the petition . to load , said ward clerk wally d . nyles . the petition reads in part : even children can type in the word cat or home or soup and instantly be inundated with offensive and disturbing pornographic images . parents and individuals have to go to great lengths to install internet filters that often don t weed out all porn we are asking that people who are interested in porn should have to seek it and choose it . they should have to opt in for it by making arrangements to receive it with their internet service provider . everyone else should be free from it and assumed opt out . brother jerry goff , whose brother jacques refusal to sign the petition gives him quite a rise , happily shared the petition on facebook , and said the moral imperative was throbbing within him . the petition has a goal of 100 , 000 signatures . i m pretty sure that means once we hit that threshold , pornography will vanish from the internet quicker than a minimized browser upon heard footsteps near the downstairs study , goff said . according to the zipcodes listed , the petition is making rounds throughout utah , idaho , and the rich - pockets of southern california . i m impressed with Lds members choosing to hold to the rod . it d be one thing if they were going to extremely overt lengths to hide human habits by overcompensating with public denials , but i just see the humble , principled suggestions toward living a moral life clean from licentious behavior , said af east 17 th ward bishop forrest gildt . sister tammy wilkers asked her husband jeff wilkers when he was going to sign the petition , and he said , [ opt - in ] is gonna be like those i promise i am 18 warnings , right yeah , i can sign that . i think that is a great idea , i ve never seen the reason to want to click the i promise i am 18 button , not now , and definitely not when i wasn t of legal consumptive age back in the day . yeah , i ll sign this petition . will it show up on my credit card bill oh , it s free . yeah , cool . you are going down . yes , youporn ; you are going down .
phoenix , az arizona gov . jan brewer is calling on taxpayers to foot a 1 . 5 million dollar bill , which would change the state fish from the apache trout to something less symbolically tolerant of brown people . this morning , the governor s office released a statement , which read in part : we don t want people to get the idea that we support diversity in arizona , and having our fine state represented by a weird indian fish clearly sends mixed signals to the public . the governor s statement also cited the 1997 change in utah s state fish from the rainbow trout to a less gay fish , the bonneville cutthroat trout . that s the kind of moxie we need from our lawmakers here , the statement read . we would like to change our state fish to something badass like the bonneville cutthroat , but it isn t indigenous to arizona , so that ain t happening . this proposal has the public at both sides of the immigration debate in an upheaval . first they pass unconstitutional laws that basically criminalize being a minority , and now this , said legal arizona resident miguel hernandez . it s ludicrous but minorities are not the only irritated party . benny gibbs , a 62 - year - old white republican , claims that it isn t the state fish that needs to be changed . i like that our state is represented by such a beautiful and majestic fish like the apache trout . i think it s the indian tribe that needs to change its name . after all , this is america not native america we were here first . when reached for a follow - up comment , gov . brewer shied away from providing details about how the 1 . 5 million dollars would be allocated , but she interjected that there are other methods we can employ to solve this problem , such as hiring death squads to entirely eradicate this breed of trout from arizona waters , but that seems extreme to me .

claiming he was just putin one over us , the kremlin announced today that russian troops will begin withdrawing from crimea , since the elaborate april fools joke has run its course . our leader has a great sense of humor , and so few know this , said a kremlin official to beehive bugle s russia correspondent . he loves to mimic the posturings of a strong , aggressive leader , but deep down he is soft as teddy bear . president putin , a man not typically known for his sense of humor , appears to have fooled almost everybody , including many in his own country . i love a good practical joke , and i wanted everyone to think we were veering towards another cold war , the apparently jovial , zest - for - life leader said , only a few weeks after drawing criticism for his bellicose behavior towards the ukraine . i mean , only a fool would go russian in like that , the usually joyless , headstrong leader further quipped . while relieved , leaders have expressed their disapproval with putin s peace - jeopardizing hi - jinks . responding to this , putin has simply said oh , crimea river , after which world leaders had to laugh and admit it was pretty funny . oh , that guy what are we going to do with him , said one diplomat in the newly - restored g8 council . share this : facebook twitter tumblr reddit google print email

when john stonestreet and i wrote restoring all things in 2014 , the hardest part was deciding what stories to put in and what stories to leave out . we were looking for stories of christians making a difference in their communities . we found hundreds of them , and it soon became evident that there were thousands . although we crammed more than a hundred into the book , we had barely touched the tip of a magnificent iceberg . since the book was published , john and i have encountered hundreds more stories that if we were writing restoring all things today would be candidates for inclusion . take , for example , the story of charlotte rescue mission . executive director tony marciano believes any attempt to help the homeless that does not include a strong spiritual component is destined for failure . the statistics bear him out . the vast majority of people who go through addiction rehabilitation programs relapse soon after leaving the program . but charlotte rescue mission s success rate , while nowhere near 100 percent , dramatically exceeds that of secular programs . why marciano told me : if you could use one word to explain what we do , it s transformation . we work from the inside out . we don t work from the outside in . we re not looking at the symptoms of what causes them to self - destruct . we want to know why they re doing it . at the root of an addict is what we call a shame - based identity . shame says , i am wrong . i m defective . if you knew me , you wouldn t like me . if god knew me , god wouldn t like me . unless they deal with that shame - based identity , that person will continue to self - destruct over and over and over again . why the gospel why are we a gospel rescue mission because it s the power of god s unconditional love that is found in jesus christ that really can crack through that shame - based identity . in restoring all things , john and i told stories , like that of charlotte rescue mission , because stories have the power to change both minds and hearts . jesus taught his followers with stories . in fact , mark 4 : 34 says , he did not speak to them except in parables . my friend ( and wilberforce weekend 2018 speaker ) andrew peterson is fond of saying , if you want someone to hear the truth , tell them the truth . if you want them to love the truth , tell them a story . damon of athens once said , give me the songs of a people , and i care not who writes their laws . that s why every friday , my end - of - week column will include stories of christians who are engaged with god in the great task of restoring all things . these stories will address one or more of the four questions at the beginning of restoring all things : what is good in our culture that we can promote , protect , and celebrate what is missing in our culture that we can creatively contribute what is evil in our culture that we can stop what is broken in our culture that we can restore i already have dozens of such stories , but we can never have too many . the world is hungry for them . and in a society that is at best apprehensive , and more often antagonistic , toward christian ideas , the credibility of the church often depends on such stories . james 1 : 22 tells us to be not merely hearers of the word , but doers also . these kinds of accounts provide evidence of the doing to a watching and skeptical world . stories proclaim that we christians are ready , willing , and able to practice what we preach . and they provide examples and encouragement for others to go and do likewise . so if you know of people and ministries that deserve a wider audience , please email me at wsmith colsoncenter . org . i can t promise you i ll use every story . but i can promise you i will consider every idea , and respond to every email . the late robert webber , an influential teacher , writer , and theologian who spent much of his career at wheaton college , once said , the most pressing spiritual question of our time is this : who gets to narrate the world let it be us . let us begin now .

es morning update january 25 th 2018 headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next well , the bulls finally lost the rising green trendline of support . but the sideways action from the 22 nd this week has only formed a tight trading range from the high to the low yesterday . today s challenge is for the bulls to make yet another higher high on the backside of that rising green trendline . and from the looks of the maCD s they will have an excellent chance at doing so . the move down yesterday did weaken the bulls a little but overall it s still a bullish market . it s looking more and more like the next possible turn period will be around the FomC meeting next week . but while in the old days we would see it have a bullish close about 80 of the time that day , ( then the next day would turn down ) , we haven t seen that happen much in the last year or so . it s become almost a non - event lately as everyone knows well in advance what s going to be said at the meeting so it s no big surprise , and therefore no big reaction in the market . anyway , for today it looks bullish to me but it s still very overbought on many time frames . it s hard to chase a market so overbought and every time you see a pullback you think it s finally going to rollover and do at least an abC move down , but instead it s just one fast wave down that ends and then it s back to the bullish trend . nothing new here gang , just more of the same ol never ending trend upwards to the moon . the maCD on the 6 hour chart ( not shown ) is trying to curl back up as well , which should add support for this 60 minute maCD pointing up this morning . odds are good for a new all time high again today so i d be shocked if it didn t happen . i don t have any more to say as again it looks bullish right now . anything can change by the close , so if it peaks out and rolls over i d look for that 2840 area now as support and the new yellow rising trendline i just drew . source : < URL >

top dem calls release the memo conspiracy theory of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by adam salazar , infowars : democrats downplay memo ahead of release a classified memo purporting to show the obama justice department illegally spied on the trump campaign is nothing but a conspiracy theory , according to a top democrat representative . in a letter addressed to the chairman of the house judiciary committee tuesday , rep . jerry nadler said the so - called nunes memo has been distorted by republicans to their political advantage and distracts from the special counsel investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election . it is a profoundly misleading document . the house committee on the judiciary must act without delay to correct the record and in your words to permit special counsel mueller to complete his investigation without interference , nadler says . asking for a copy of the memo to be made available to the committee , nadler tells house judiciary chairman bob goodlatte that the four - page memo is being misrepresented and that intelligence committee chairman devin nunes has concocted a conspiracy theory . you and i have had the opportunity to review many of the documents that the intelligence committee claims are the basis for its memo . those materials tell a very different story than the conspiracy theory concocted by chairman nunes and being repeated in the press . nadler also notes concerns with reports that russian bots are promoting the releasethememo hashtag and attempting to amplify this message . rep . nadler isn t the first democrat to come out against the memo ahead of its release . ranking house intelligence committee member adam schiff also pushed back against it , saying nunes memo was rife with factual inaccuracies , and is meant only to give republican house members a distorted view of the fbi . meanwhile republicans including rep . matt gaetz say the memo highlights injustices that go to the very foundations of democracy . i think that this will not end just with firings , gaetz told fox news last week . i believe there are people who will go to jail . the house may vote as early as next week on whether to release the memo , which the president would then have to sign off on . white house press secretary sarah sanders on tuesday said president trump would likely be inclined to sign off on a release of the memo in the interest of full transparency . we certainly support full transparency and we believe that is at the house intel committee to make that decision at this point , sanders said . it sounds like there are some members in the house that have some real concerns with what is in that memo and feel very strongly that the american public should be privy to see it . read more infowars . com source : < URL >
have you seen palladium s tradable price pattern headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next are you prepared for the next big move in the metals markets would you like to know what to expect in the immediate future that could save you thousands of dollars then pay attention to this message as we share something most traders are overlooking right now . our research team at technical traders ltd . have spent years developing our skills and financial modeling systems . right now , many traders are seeing the big upward price swings in the metals as a sign that prices will continue higher . well , in the long run , they are correct . but right now we believe the metals will roll over and trend lower for the next few weeks setting up for the next leg higher . palladium is a perfect example of this rollover expectation . both the current long term monthly chart shows signs of a massive double top , and the daily chart wedGe / pennant formation is likely a washout high rotation pattern that will prompt lower prices over the next few days / weeks . Monthly palladiUM chart this monthly chart to us is nothing more than a reason for the overbought palladium market to have a minor pullback before potentially running to new highs . we could see a couple weeks or potentially a few months of weaker prices , but the point here is that price is overbought and at resistance on the long - term chart and imminent pullback is likely to occur for a tradable short or to re - enter after the price has corrected and shows signs of strength for another run higher . daily palladiUM chart as you can see from this chart , we are expecting a rotation lower based on our modeling systems predictive capabilities that will result in a substantially lower price swing possibly as much as - 8 to - 10 . we believe support will be found just above the 1000 price level . additionally , our adaptive dynamic learning ( adl ) modeling system is designed to scan historical price activity of any chart and find the unique price and technical indicator formations that operate as dna markers for the price . it then continues to scan for new or repeating dna markers in the market to determine probable outcomes of the price going forward . in this case , the adl system is predicting a lower price swing to near 1020 near or after february 8 th . after this price contraction , the adl system is expecting a solid rally to form . this should be important to all investors because long traders in the metals should wait for this pullback to happen before getting into heavy positions . our analysis shows we should see a - 4 to - 8 price pullback within the next week or two before support will be found . obviously , buying near the lowest point is the objective of trading and we believe the february 5 th through february 8 th time frame should provide the optimal bottom rotation period for metals traders . would you like to receive daily video analysis of our research for all the major markets as well as continue to receive our advanced research reports want to know that the Us majors indexes are going to do tomorrow or next week take a minute to investigate the technical traders [ just visit here ] to learn how we can assist you in your trading . learn how we called this move in the Us indexes for 2018 and how we can continue to identify market moves before they happen with our proprietary modeling systems . chris vermeulen source : < URL >

summit therapeutics shares jump on exciting interim results of ezutromid study of readers think this story is fact . add your two cents . headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next shares in summit therapeutics plc ( lon : sUmm , nasdaQ : smmt ) shot up by a third after it released encouraging data for its treatment for duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) . the interim results for the phaseout study revealed a statistically significant and meaningful reduction in muscle damage in patients taking the company s treatment , ezutromid . read : the release in detail the significant reduction in muscle damage coupled with the increase in utrophin expression seen in phaseout dmd trial patients at 24 weeks is very encouraging as it suggests ezutromid may slow the relentless cycle of muscle fibre degeneration and regeneration that is a hallmark of dmd , said professor francesco muntoni . he is a director of the dubowitz neuromuscular centre , at the Ucl institute of child health and great ormond street hospital for children , london , uk , and the principal investigator in summit phase ii clinical trial . these favourable interim results are certainly a step forward in the development of utrophin modulation as a treatment approach for this fatal disease in all patients with dmd , he added . the headlines from the study treatment with ezutromid resulted in a statistically significant and meaningful reduction in muscle damage as measured by a 23 decrease in mean developmental myosin in muscle biopsies at 24 weeks compared to baseline ( 11 . 37 to 8 . 76 , 95 ci , - 4 . 33 , - 0 . 90 ) . developmental myosin is a biomarker of muscle damage and is found in repairing fibres . a total of 14 of 22 patients showed a decrease in developmental myosin , with five of those showing a greater than 40 reduction . increase in mean utrophin protein intensity levels of 7 in biopsies at 24 weeks compared to baseline ( 0 . 370 to 0 . 396 , 95 ci , - 0 . 005 , 0 . 058 ) . duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare muscle - wasting disease that affects boys . summit s research into the role of utrophin in dmd was based on the work of dame kay davis , who made the link 30 years ago . dystrophin replacement the protein is functionally and structurally similar to dystrophin , which is lacking in children with the disease . preclinical studies revealed the continued expression of utrophin had a meaningful , positive effect on muscle performance . the current trial appears to bear out the current findings . the surprise is that its effects of ezutromid have been detected so early in the process . investors will be updated next on the trial in the third - quarter , when phaseout hits the 48 - week stage . on the back of the interim data , the shares shot up 60 p to 237 . 5 p , valuing summit at almost 180 mln . hugely excited the company s chief executive , glyn edwards , on a conference call said he was hugely excited by the data as he announced plans to accelerate preparations for a pivotal clinical trial . he said he wanted to apply steroids to the current plans to make them bigger , better and faster . analysts were taken through a presentation by david roblin , the company s chief medical officer . this data set is strong and we are really pleased with it , he said . adds conference call update story by proactiveinvestors source : < URL >

why did president trump really extend the iran nuclear deal again january 22 , 2018 like many conservative iran watchers , i was disappointed with president trump ' s decision last week to extend the controversial july 2015 nuclear agreement with iran ( the jcpoa ) by waiving sanctions and giving congress and european states a final chance to " fix " this agreement in 120 days . this decision was especially disappointing given the recent iranian protests and that the president issued a similar ultimatum in october 2016 . however , there appear to be some undisclosed reasons for this decision that give me hope the president will kill this terrible agreement in the near future . a deeply flawed and dangerous agreement critics of the jcpoa were hoping that president trump would reimpose u . s . sanctions - which would essentially kill the iran deal - because they believe he was exactly right when he said during the 2016 presidential campaign that the jcpoa is the worst deal ever negotiated . to get this " legacy " nuclear agreement with iran for president obama , secretary of state john kerry and other obama - administration officials made any concession necessary to tehran . this included allowing iran to continue enriching uranium with over 5 , 000 centrifuges and to develop advanced centrifuges ; to construct a plutonium - producing heavy - water reactor in iran ; to wipe clean a long list of unanswered questions about nuclear - weapons - related activity ; and to agree to a deal with extremely weak verification provisions . there are credible reports of iranian cheating on the agreement , including several accounts from german intelligence agencies . it gets worse . the jcpoa lifted terrorism - related sanctions from iranians and iranian entities . iran ' s missile program - which is a nuclear - weapons - delivery system - was excluded from the deal because of a last - minute demand by iran . under a side deal , the united states secretly paid iran 400 million in ransom to swap five innocent americans imprisoned by iran for the release by the u . s . of seven iranian criminals and the removal of 14 other iranians from an interpol wanted list . according to a bombshell december 18 , 2017 , politico story , " the secret backstory of how obama let hezbollah off the hook , " the obama administration also blocked an investigation of drug trafficking by hezbollah - iran ' s terrorist proxy - to secure the nuclear deal . president obama and secretary kerry claimed that the nuclear deal would help bring iran into the " community of nations " and improve u . s . - iran relations . this didn ' t happen , however . iran ' s behavior got worse . it sent troops into syria after the deal was announced . it continued to support the houthi rebels in yemen and gave them missiles that they used to attack saudi arabia and ships in the red sea . it also has proceeded with its ballistic - missile program and tested some missiles with the words " israel must be wiped off the map " emblazoned on them . iran also appears to have used sanctions relief to fund terrorism . in 2016 , tehran reportedly pledged 70 million to the palestinian terrorist group islamic jihad to conduct " jihad " against the state of israel . in 2017 , the iranian government quadrupled its annual support to hezbollah to 830 million and resumed providing aid to the palestinian terrorist group hamas . although the amount of iranian payments to hamas has not been released , we do know that tehran provided it with 50 million per month prior to a breakdown in relations in 2012 . the iranian government ' s squandering of huge sums of sanctions relief for belligerent purposes worsened the country ' s poor economy and led to the recent protests after a rise in prices of eggs and poultry . food prices are a sensitive issue in iran since the price of many basic foods increased by 40 percent over the last year . there also is a high rate of inflation - about 10 percent in 2016 - and youth unemployment of about 40 percent . the economic situation is so bad that there are reports , according to the los angeles times , of iranians selling their organs to raise cash . president trump ' s iran - deal fixes fall far short these and other major problems with the jcpoa are why president trump has repeatedly criticized it . but last week , when trump gave congress and european leaders 120 days to fix its major flaws , he demanded the following changes that mostly fall far short of doing so : 1 ) require iran to allow immediate inspections at all sites requested by international inspectors . this fix misses the mark because iran is already required under the jcpoa to allow iaea inspectors access to any site they ask to visit . the problem is that the iaea refuses to ask to visit places such as military bases that iran says are off - limits to inspectors . 2 ) ensure that iran never comes close to possessing a nuclear weapon . a laudable goal , but vague and meaningless , especially since the president ' s fixes do not address two of the jcpoa ' s major flaws : allowing iran to enrich uranium and giving it a light - water reactor . 3 ) lifting the jcpoa ' s sunset provisions so the deal never expires . this is also meaningless because it fails to address many flaws of the nuclear deal , such as uranium enrichment , and leaves unanswered questions about iran ' s past nuclear - weapons work . there is no point in lifting the jcpoa ' s sunset provisions if iran is allowed to continue enriching uranium . 4 ) congress must legally link iran ' s nuclear and missile programs and subject the missile program to severe sanctions . unlike the above changes , this one is sensible and long overdue . the weaknesses of the president ' s jcpoa fixes reflect the weaknesses of his top advisers on the iran deal - principally national security adviser mcmaster and secretary of state tillerson . both have opposed president trump ' s efforts to withdraw from the iran deal over the past year and have repeatedly tried to delay the president ' s final decision on the agreement . but it doesn ' t matter how weak these fixes are because there is no chance that congress or european states will do anything to implement them . congress is divided between democrats determined to protect president obama ' s legacy deal with iran and republicans who view it as a dangerous fraud . as a result , it is very unlikely that senators bob corker ( r . , tenn . ) and ben cardin ( d . , md . ) will succeed in their effort to pass legislation to fix the accord . europe does not want to amend the jcpoa , in part because of trade deals it struck with iran after the accord came into effect . and to no one ' s surprise , iran is adamant that it will never renegotiate the jcpoa . what ' s really behind president trump ' s " final " extension of the iran deal although president trump ' s decision last week was disappointing , there may be three undisclosed reasons behind his move that suggest he plans to withdraw from the agreement in the near future . the first two reasons are based on a discussion about the iran deal that a friend of mine had with the president last month . first , trump told my friend that even though he gave congress 90 days in october to pass legislation to fix the jcpoa , he believed that strong partisan differences among lawmakers would prevent them from passing any substantive fixes . i believe that this remains the president ' s view . so why would the president kick the nuclear deal to congress for a second time if he predicts that congress will not act that brings me to a second possible reason for president ' s decision : as much as he hates the jcpoa and wants to kill it , he told my friend , north korea takes precedence , and he does not want both crises blowing up at the same time . given the extremely high tensions with north korea and the need to work with our allies to isolate pyongyang , it makes sense that president trump might want to delay gutting the iran deal at this time . there may be a third reason president trump extended the iran deal : he needs better personnel to implement an exit from the jcpoa . with rumors swirling that mcmaster and tillerson could leave the administration over the next couple of months , trump might be postponing a decision to exit the jcpoa until they are replaced by advisers who will fully support and aggressively implement such a decision . ambassador john bolton would be the best person president trump could bring into his administration to oversee a u . s . withdrawal from the iran deal . not only does bolton have extensive government experience and an in - depth understanding of the iran nuclear issue , he also authored a plan last august on how the u . s could withdraw from the jcpoa and work with our allies - especially israel - to replace it with a much better arrangement . making ambassador bolton the next national - security adviser could end the infighting in the administration on the iran deal and also would probably improve the implementation of trump ' s national - security policies on radical islam , north korea , climate change , russia , china , and other issues . so i say to my fellow conservative iran watchers : take heart . although president trump ' s decision to extend the iran deal again was disappointing , i believe he had good reasons for delaying a u . s . exit from the agreement . signs suggest that he will withdraw from the accord in the near future , possibly when he has a better national - security team in place .
ruth bader ginsburg ( rbg ) is something of a hero to women across the country . the supreme court justice is one of the pioneers of the court and continues to be one of the most relevant people in the legal system . ginsburg , 84 , has a rigorous workout and maintains her schedule . recently , saturday night live actor , kate mckinnon , portrayed her , and the justice enjoyed it . during a sundance cinema talks conversation , people wondered how much longer she could carry on with her vital job as a liberal justice . she said thanks for asking , according to the los angeles times : as long as i can do the job full steam , i will be here . she joined the supreme court in 1993 . democrats are concerned that should she leave the court , donald trump would fill the seat with a more conservative man and make the court right - leaning heavy . the earliest she could leave the supreme court would be 2021 , at age 88 , but she does not plan to step down even then . rbg has law clerks staffed through the court s 2020 term . when justice ruth bader ginsburg started her legal career , it was a different world . at the sundance film festival , she spoke about the metoo movement , npr reported : it s about time . for so long women were silent , thinking there was nothing you could do about it , but now the law is on the side of women , or men , who encounter harassment and that s a good thing . so far it s been great . when i see women appearing every place in numbers , i m less worried about a backlash than i might have been 20 years ago . ginsburg recalled times she experienced sexism as a student and a teacher : every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is , although we didn t have a name for it . she asked a cornell chemistry instructor for a practice exam , but he gave her a copy of the real one : i knew exactly what he wanted in return . ( i ) went to his office and said , how dare you how dare you do this and that was the end of that . when ginsburg was at columbia law school , the school laid off 25 women in the maintenance department , but not one man . rbg headed to the university s vice president for business to tell him that the school was violating title Vii . he told her : professor ginsburg , columbia has excellent wall street lawyers representing them and would you like a cup of tea ginsburg had two children at the same time she was founding the aclU women s right s project , and working as a columbia professor . in addition , she litigated cases across the country and before the supreme court . one day she got a call from her son james school : . the child was what his teachers called hyperactive and i called lively . ( after a call from the school , she said ) this child has two parents . please alternate calls . it s his father s turn . the justice said : the calls came barely once a semester and the reason was they had to think long and hard before asking a man to take time out of his work day to come to the school . the remarkable thing about marty ( her husband professor ginsburg ) is that he cared that i had a brain . no guy up until then was the least interested in how i thought . featured image via getty images / robin marchant .
palestinian anti - semitism january 22 , 2018 when a pro - palestinian group tweet an anti - semitism cartoon straight out of der sterner and a major pro - israel advocate uses facebook to inform people of this awful crime , what happens the pro - israel advocate is blocked by facebook for distributing hate material when a pro - palestinian group tweet an anti - semitism cartoon straight out of der stermer , and a major pro - israel advocate uses facebook to make people aware of this awful crime , what happens the pro - israel advocate is blocked by facebook for distributing hate material that pro - israel advocate is me . how stupid and wrong can facebook and their algorithms be do they really think an israeli jew could share such hateful anti - jewish material to promote such a disgraceful anti - israel screed possibly , having seen examples of horrendous anti - israel slander by a number of israeli jews . but try contacting a human being at facebook to tell them of their mistake . impossible . the faceless facebook workers are letting the programmed robots rule . to the point , this awful cartoon highlights what i have been speaking and writing about for years . at the deep and nasty heart of pro - palestinian activists is an inner jew hatred .
sen . dick durbin ( d - ill . ) ( screenshot of c - span video ) ( cnsnews . com ) - speaking on the senate floor monday prior to a vote to break the filibuster and eventually reopen the federal government , democratic whip sen . dick durbin ( d - ill . ) called the issue of legalizing illegals under the daca program ( deferred action for childhood arrivals ) is the civil rights issue of our time . so many of you cast a vote that was very hard and very difficult , because you believed as i did that the issue of immigration , the issue of the dreamers is the civil rights issue of our time . you stuck your necks out and said i m willing to go on record even if it s going to be hard to explain back home , and i will never forget that , durbin said prior to the vote . durbin said he s seen something in the last few days that the senate has not seen in years : constructive bipartisan conversations and dialogue on the floor about the future of this institution and what the senate will be from this point forward . he thanked sens . susan collins ( r - maine ) , lisa murkowski ( r - alaska ) , jeff flake ( r - ariz . ) , lindsey graham ( r - s . c . ) , and cory gardner ( r - colo . ) , who ve been working on this issue for so long to try to make a positive impact on this debate so that we can move forward . i cannot tell my colleagues how many have come up to me from the other side of the aisle and said , we re with you on this issue . we want to help you get this done . each of them has a little different take on what that means , but i do believe them , and i do believe we have this opportunity to move together , the senator said . it will be the first time some have seen the senate return to a regular order and have a constructive debate , durbin said . my last word is this : we have gathered the largest bipartisan group of senators to ever commit to moving forward on the dream act and immigration . we have a process . i want to thank senator mcconnell for explicitly saying today , it will be a level playing field . it will be open to both sides . we will move to the issue as you characterized it this morning of daca and immigration . thank you for doing that . i believe that that sets the stage for us to work together , he said . in a vote of 81 to 18 , the senate voted monday after durbin s speech to invoke cloture and end the filibuster that prompted the government shutdown . prior to durbin s speech , senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - n . y . ) took to the senate floor and blamed the lack of consensus on the republicans not knowing what president donald trump wanted . the reason why the republican majority had such difficulty finding consensus is they could never get a firm grip on what the president of their party wanted to do . these days you never know who to deal with when it comes to the republicans . the republican leaders told me to work out a deal with the white house . the white house said work it out with republican leaders on the hill , schumer said . separately , president trump turned away from not one , but two bipartisan compromises . each would have averted this shutdown . each would have led to a deal on the budget and health care and disaster aid and things like opioids and veterans and pensions and on immigration , the senator said . my recent offer to the president was a generous one . i put his signature issue on the table in exchange for daca , and still he turned away . president trump s unwillingness to compromise caused the trump shutdown and brought us to this moment . the facts are well known , he added . according to white house budget director mick mulvaney , schumer offered to authorize the wall , but not fund it . full funding for the wall , no , mulvaney told chris wallace on fox news sunday when asked whether schumer offered to fully fund the border wall in a meeting with president donald trump on friday . what mr . schumer offered the president was an authorization for funding , not an appropriation . i know that ' s deep down in the weeds for folks who don ' t live in washington , d . c . , but the difference between authorization and appropriation is like night and day , he said . there was already authorization to build wall on the southern border that chuck schumer voted for in 2006 . it hasn ' t been built because the money was never appropriated , it was never funded , mulvaney said . and that ' s the same deal that chuck schumer offered on saturday .

donald trump has a thing about the word nuclear . he has been baiting north korea s leader , kim jong un , for months , threatening that his ( nuclear ) button is bigger than the smaller nation s button . now , the man in the oval office has urged the senate to go nuclear . what does that mean and will they go along with him trump has been hiding somewhere within the white house , and the only signs of life are his tweets . that is , unless you count uber - conservative staffer , stephen miller . the president sent out this tweet : great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border . the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked . if stalemate continues , republicans should go to 51 ( nuclear option ) and vote on real long term budget , no c . r . s the president wants senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r - kY ) to go 51 ( nuclear option ) . that would fundamentally shift the power of the legislature . now , it takes 60 senator votes to pass the budget and restart the great machine that is our government . perhaps , trump realizes his republican rule will end at the mid - term elections , and this is his last , best chance to do anything . hopefully , senator mcconnell will hold firm in his belief that 60 votes are necessary . of course , mcconnell s wife , elaine chao , is trump s secretary of transportation . that may give the president some leverage over the senator . ironically , chao is an immigrant herself . she came to the u . s . with her family from taiwan when she was just eight years old . trump made a deal with senate minority leader , chuck schumer ( d - nY ) . senator schumer told 45 to tell him how much he wanted his wall on the u . s . s southern border . trump did , and the deal was set . hours later , the president cancelled it . as schumer says , the president can t agree to a yes . one of the biggest problems for both democrats and republicans is that trying to deal with trump is like trying to deal with jello . the president has changed his mind over and over . unfortunately , miller has interfered in the process multiple times . senators lindsey graham ( r - sc ) and dick durban ( d - il ) initially went to the white house with a deal already in hand . by the time they got there , miller had invited a group of far right republicans and quashed the deal . someone needs to lead just not stephen miller , the little dictator . featured image via getty images .
kellyanne conway has finally begun to come out of the shadows after her alternative facts fiasco . it has taken some time , but donald trump is a little short on people to speak for him . when the president tried to use his chief speechwriter , stephen miller , the result was disastrous . miller came across like a little dictator , so conway got her shot in the limelight , once again . on fox friends , she decided she could talk about the super bowl and trash talk former secretary of state , hillary clinton at the same time . conway was wearing her eagles green and managed to slip in a comment about donald trump being friends with the owner of the patriots , bob kraft : the patriots are in the super bowl again and they haven t been in the super bowl since last year . we were so happy to have the patriots here ( at the white house ) last year when they won . but we want to have the eagles here this coming year . kellyanne conway continued : and i ll just say that the underdog here is the eagles and you know me , i love an underdog . the patriots are like that woman ( hillary clinton ) whose name i don t mention on tv anymore . people always count out the eagles . oddly , when she appeared on cnn recently , conway was firm that nobody in the white house discusses clinton : we don t care about her . nobody here talks about her . nobody here talks about hillary clinton , i promise you . the counselor to the president had high praise for her eagles nfL team during her fox friends interview , because they never took a knee while the national anthem was playing . many other players did so to peacefully protest police violence against the black community and racism . conway said they never discuss clinton , but in trump s first year as president , he tweeted about clinton and / or her 2016 presidential campaign 77 times . that averaged out to one hillary tweet every 4 . 7 days . trump is obsessed with clinton . on january 11 , he tweeted : disproven and paid for by democrats dossier used to spy on trump campaign . did fbi use intel tool to influence the election foxandfriend did dems or clinton also pay russians where are hidden and smashed dnc servers where are crooked hillary emails what a mess donald trump capped off the end of the year , slamming hillary clinton in a tweet : vanity fair , which looks like it is on its last legs , is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at crooked h . anna wintour , who was all set to be amb to court of st james s a big fundraiser for ch , is beside herself in grief begging for forgiveness in late october , the president tweeted : never seen such republican anger UnitY as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton make fake dossier ( now 12 , 000 , 000 ) trump could barely wait until after january 1 , 2018 to send out his first tweet : crooked hillary clinton s top aid ( sic ) , huma abedin , has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols . she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents . remember sailors pictures on submarine jail deep state justice dept must finally act also on comey others . check out the video of kellyanne conway using the super bowl to talk trash clinton on fox friends : featured image via getty images / mark wilson .
he always told her that he liked it rough . but when she got caught up in the surge of excitement , she took things much further than he ever desired . during an aggressive lovemaking session in taiwan , a wife accidentally bit off her husband s testicle . and when they realized what they had done , they called for an ambulance . during the call , the wife repeatedly says , i accidentally bit it off i accidentally bit it off and when the emergency crew arrived , the man was holding his severed testicle in a rice bowl . the violent accident happened the day after christmas in taichung in west taiwan . we can only imagine the horrible screams the husband must have released after his wife chewed his testicle off during their post - christmas lovemaking session . somehow he managed to remain conscious following the accident . and when emergency responders arrived , he was wearing a bathrobe and holding his testicle in a bowl . he was 51 - years - old , and his surname is wang . a news website in taiwan named apple daily reported that the 49 - year - old wife with the surname hsieh accidentally tore of her husband s right testicle when things got out of control in the bedroom . the emergency call was placed at about 2 am on december 26 . she was screaming for them to send an ambulance after she accidentally castrated her middle - aged husband . according to apple daily , the couple has been married for many years . and although they have two children together and have known each other for a long time , they still have a passionate love life . but perhaps it was a bit too intense . wang worked at a car repair shop and was enjoying the vigorous lovemaking session with his wife until she chewed his testicle off his body . paramedics arrived to find the couple panicking . they were waiting for them at the entrance to their apartment . the paramedics had never seen anything like it before . but that did not cause them to hesitate . they rushed wang to tungs taichung metro harbor hospital . he was treated by the emergency room supervisor named lu li - hau . li found wang s scrotum to be torn apart . he sutured it back together , but he was unable to reattach the man s testicle because he feared it would result in an infection . we were concerned that he would not be able to regain proper function of his testicle , which could lead to male infertility in the future , dr . li explained . dr . li does not know whether the accident has affected wang s fertility . and at the time of this writing , wang is still recovering in the hospital . the injury appears not to be life - threatening . some reports indicate that the accident occurred during a surge of excitement . and hsieh is reported , according to some sources , to suffer from a mental illness . it is unclear if wang will ever be able to forgive his wife for the emasculating mistake . fortunately , there are not many stories like this happening around the world . what is your reaction to this tragic accident in the bedroom
a pennsylvania mom has taken to social media to claim her daughter s teacher re - pierced her ears . as though teachers were not already getting enough slack for their inability to keep classrooms under control and provide a solid education to america s next generation . all it takes is stories like this to deepen the mistrust that american people have in the educational system . the mother , a young woman named amanda , claimed her 7 - year old daughter had pierced ears when she was 3 but had not worn earrings for more than a week before letting them close up again . apparently , she would wear clip - ons occasionally , but most went without earrings especially at school . that s why amanda was so surprised when her daughter , who goes to school in new york city , came home with bruises on her lobes and freshly pierced ears . initially , her daughter was unwilling to go into detail about the piercings . after a prolonged period of questioning by amanda , she finally got her daughter to tell her the truth : her teacher had initiated the ear piercing and actually gone through with it despite her daughter saying it hurt this is a clear violation of the laws governing the school board . teachers are not allowed to do anything to the children they teach without getting consent from the parents , which doubles as consent for the kids . if you are a teacher and want to take your class on a field trip , you have to get the school to confirm it s okay and then have all the kids parents sign an insurance form to confirm it s okay . this process usually takes a couple of weeks to organize ( at minimum ) and requires lots of planning and waiting . the point is : as a teacher you cannot do anything to or with the kids you teach before contacting their parents . in this case , the teacher was acting totally outside of their purview in piercing a child s ear . were they doing it to show off to other students did they use excessive force why did they not ask the parents if it was okay beforehand these are all questions that we will probably never get the answer to . suffice to say it leaves parents worrying about the state of their childrens education when they cannot even trust the teachers to be responsible . there was a time when teachers were ideal role models for the kids they taught . they would always arrive on time , never swear around kids , and always acted with kindness and decency . teachers were basically held to a higher standard then they are now , and children are the ones having to deal with the impact of this shift in standards . the problem is it s unclear what positive direction to take . what does the future hold it s uncertain because there is no way of knowing what the next generation will be like . all that can be said is that parents need to be excellent role models in every way for their kids . kids should be able to look up and mimic the best attributes that human beings have to offer : decency , understanding , respect for personal space these are all attributes that appear to be losing ground .
some people will try to sue others for anything and everything , when it seems like it would be a whole lot easier to go out and get a job of their own . the most recent of oddball charges , comes from a divorced new jersey couple . the woman is being sued by her ex - husband for writing certain memos on the weekly alimony checks that she writes him . the plaintiff is francis j . wagner jr . and he is reporting that his ex - wife is exacerbating his physical and emotional health because of the notes that she writes on the alimony checks that she sends him every week . as far as i m concerned i can write anything i want on the memo line because it s a note to myself , ex - wife , diane wagner said . i was the victim in that marriage . what more blood does he want from me i pay him religiously . diane , who allegedly was the victim of her ex - husband s drunken episodes for their ten years of marriage , has had enough of his immaturity . in addition to the weekly checks for 186 that he receives from diane , wagner also collects social security / disability . diane couldn t afford a divorce trial so she agreed to give him 744 a month in spousal support for six years , as long as he agreed that their marriage was over . on top of all of this , diane is currently receiving treatment for cancer and while she can barely afford the spousal support checks , her request for a reduction was denied . the law firm that is fighting on behalf of francis , trautmann trautmann , shared this very embarrassing post on their facebook page , while she was regularly sending her ex alimony payments alimony for the man the caption read , next to a photo of one of diane s redacted checks . what s funny is that the now ex - wife so hated paying our client the husband 800 per month for the next six years as alimony and she had written alimony / adult child support in the memo of the weekly checks until we put a stop to that harassment . seems more like diane is the one enduring mental distress in this situation . when i found out my personal business was on the facebook page , that caused me distress , she said . according to diane , this post was dated on march 11 , 2015 , and she didn t even receive notice from the law firm until july . the firm s july 22 nd complaint read the following please be advised that your writings are causing my client severe emotional distress and have led to him having sustained heart attacks in recent weeks . this letter didn t stop diane from her freedom of speech though , and since then she has been writing the acronym , foad on the checks . evidently , it means f off and die . the majority of commenters sided with diane he is just a lazy ass that doesn t want to work n then wants to sue now so he can take whatever she has left he is worse than an ass , his ex is suffering from cancer n the only thing on his empty mind is how to get more money to make sure his lazy ass don t have to go to work . i would hope when this goes back to court that the judge does the right thing n drops all this n tells him to get a job as there will be no more money coming his way for his big boy child support . i like diane . more people should be a diane . what a loser he is . she had to pay him to get divorced did i read that right he should be paying her for putting up with him . whose side are you on
if you ve passed through the helsinki airport , you may have been surprised with an unpleasant step in your travel experience . when checking in , finnair staff have started putting passengers on weighing scales to measure their personal baggage . while this practice seems like an offensive invasion of privacy , finnair claims to be doing it to recalculate their costs of travel . it is not part of their thin air strategy , as the bbc reports . the airline is merely surveying customers so they can check estimates on the total weight of their airplanes . airlines know what the aircraft weighs , what the check - in luggage weighs , but not what passengers weigh , said p ivyt tallqvist , communications director at finnair . to this end , finnair staff have been asking passengers if they d be willing to step onto a scale . the airline has already had 180 volunteers ready to step onto the scale with their carry - on luggage . a total of 2 , 000 passengers are needed to give finnair an accurate calculation of their regular payloads , tallqvist said . until finnair started weighing their passengers , they ve been using the standard weight estimates the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) provides . the easa estimates that the average male weights about 84 . 6 kg or about 186 . 5 pounds , and the average female weights 66 . 5 kg or about 146 . 6 pounds . as for children under 12 , the easa estimates their average weight is 30 . 7 kg or about 67 . 7 pounds . but the easa averages are not as accurate as finnair would like . for example , the average man traveling first class weighs more than one in the coach or economy seating . and for women , the reverse is true . women in first - class tend to weigh less than women in coach on average . the average carryon luggage weights 6 . 1 kg or 13 . 4 pounds . but this average falls in the summer when people travel lighter and men carry heavier bags than female counterparts on average . finnair hopes to get more accurate averages so they can save money on fuel and make better estimates . this difference will then translate into potentially lower ticket prices for customers . so many people actually wanted to take part in this , tallqvist said , indicating that the weigh - ins are anonymous . no one is forced on the scale . if finnair can adjust their weight estimates , they will also change their fuel levels and the speed of travel as well as the balance of the craft . the weight of the aircraft impacts on so many things , said tallqvist . we just want to verify that the data we are using is as accurate as possible . some skeptics wonder if the weigh - in results are skewed because some people are more likely to step onto a scale than others . of course , tallqvist had an answer for that and she s not worried . so far , all sorts of people are jumping onto the scale for the anonymous weigh in .
reuters / pawel kopczynski an illustration picture shows the logo of the u . s . national security agency on the display of an iphone in berlin , june 7 , 2013 . the national security agency has reportedly been using a voice - recognition system since 2004 . siri is one of the earliest digital personal assistants available to consumers , but it was only released in 2011 . then came amazon ' s alexa in 2014 and google assistant in 2016 . these programs are designed to take commands by accurately recognizing the voice of the device owner . however , an exclusive report from the intercept recently revealed that it was the nsa which had actually developed a seemingly effective voice - recognition system dating back to 2004 . the report cited a classified nsa memo dated 2006 that listed the accomplishments of the agency ' s voice - identification system and provided some details on how it worked . like many technological developments , nsa ' s reported voice - recognition system started with human work . according to the 2006 document , transcribers working on sigint ( gathering intelligence by intercepting signals ) were later able to identify subjects through " his voice and by his unique way of speaking . " later , by applying mathematical formulas and algorithms , the process has reportedly performed " surprisingly more robust and consistent than humans . " the intercept added that while nsa had been using fingerprints and facial recognition methods to track down their targets , the agency also saw a number of successes with voiceprints - a collection of speech - related information that noted that every individual has distinct voice characteristics due to specific qualities such as the " shape of the mouth " and the " length of the larynx . " the same report took note of pieces of information previously revealed by edward snowden that claimed the nsa had tools match a target ' s voice through an alleged database of intercepted voice and video calls even if they were using foreign languages , secret codes or phone numbers . meanwhile , it is unknown whether the reported nsa voice - recognition tool has had an actual effect on consumers , especially now that voice - activated digital assistants have become a staple in newer smartphone models . however , it is important to note that programs like alexa and siri effectively work through the storage of vital biometric information from their users . it can be recalled that last year , apple did reveal that governments had made requests to collect customer data for various reasons including cases of fraud and the suspected illegal use of their products and services . as the company claimed , these requests require search warrants but reports noted that these types of letters from governments often come with a gag order .

s an diego school board members agreed tuesday night to end its parnership with designated terrorist group cair on a campaign allegedly to fight anti - muslim bullying generated by an exaggerated and mostly fake cair report . but as you will see below , the anti - bullying program was merely a smoke screen which would then allow cair s real agenda of islamic indoctrination of children to emerge . investigative project this is how it began : the san diego unified school district ( sdusd ) teamed up with the designated terrorist group cair ( council on american - islamic relations ) , a radical islamic organization , to devise and enforce an unconstitutional anti - islamophobia bullying program . as part of this program , muslim students were to get special protections and additional access to resources , while students of other faiths were excluded . cair has been in bed with the san diego school district since 2015 . in fact , in november 2015 , the board of education recognized cair for its community efforts . in preparation for the following school years , the san diego board of education had already outlined the cair plan , despite the fact that parents were rejecting its points of action : cair representative can t contain his exhilaration when the san diego unified school district initally agreed to adopt the cair islamic indoctrination program for their schools . the agenda item specifically mentioned that school board staff is redirected from forming a formal partnership with cair to forming an intercultural committee which shall include representatives of from all faiths and cultures and which shall provide input to district staff on issues of cultural sensitivities and the individual needs of various subgroups within our diverse community . not surprisingly for caliphornia , leftist speaker after speaker criticized the proposal for excluding cair and for not specifically emphasizing anti - muslim bigotry and islamophobia . cair - san diego executive director hanif mohebi managed to make that argument while still denying cair was singularly focused . we have never come out saying that it should only be one group . but i think also we should realize that it might be a mistake not to focus on groups that are targeted much more than the rest , mohebi said . so that being said , we expect the district to publicly acknowledge and recognize the work that we have done for over a decade with the school district . it was obvious , though , that board members reluctantly decided to implement a broader policy addressing bullying across cultures and religious backgrounds . vice president kevin beiser reaffirmed his support for cair and thanked it for over a decade of partnership , but said supported the revised proposal because i believe it codifies the board s commitment and my commitment to making sure that all students are safe . we do have certain groups of students who are bullied at much higher rates than other students . san diego parents not only protested this cair - sponsored program , they filed a lawsuit against the school district to stop it . sued the school district i n may , claiming the program did place muslim students above others , violating the first amendment s establishment clause , the fourteenth amendment and california law barring assistance to religion . they also claimed the anti - bullying program was a solution to an exaggerated problem . but lawyers with the freedom of conscience defense fund ( fcdf ) n may , claiming the program did place muslim students above others , violating the first amendment s establishment clause , the fourteenth amendment and california law barring assistance to religion . they also claimed the anti - bullying program was a solution to an exaggerated problem . none of the speakers advocating for cair s continued involvement addressed that constitutional concern . but the anti - bullying program was never about promoting a religion as some critics claimed , said board president richard barerra . lawsuit a report by cair s california chapters , growing in faith : california muslim youth experiences with bullying , harassment religious accommodation in schools inspired the program , fcdf sclaims . the school district s decision to back away from partnering with cair is an important victory , fcdf executive director daniel piedra told the investigative project on terrorism ( ipt ) . but he remains concerned that cair still may partner with the school district on other programs . mohebi and his allies seemed upset that they will not be able to use the school district to further their agenda , piedra said after the meeting . they talk about equality , but it s really orwellian because in their philosophy and the school board s philosophy , they are really saying that all students are equal but that some students are more equal than others , piedra said . consent decree fcdf could seek monetary damages , he said , but it may ask a judge to impose acompelling the school district to not partner with cair again . under the now - abandoned program , students accused of bullying muslim students were supposed to face restorative justice , requiring them to reconcile with the other student . the school district would provide monthly reports on the bullying of muslim students and post them online . the district s reversal follows the fcdf s amended complaint filed last month , which challenged cair s local effort to hide behind the label of being a civil rights organization . it pointed to testimony by cair co - founder and executive director nihad awad , who told the national labor relations board ( nlrb ) that it lacked jurisdiction over a fight over unionizing cair employees because cair is a religious organization . establishment clause cair letterhead includes the invocation , in the name of god , the compassionate , the merciful , which opens every chapter in the quran , charles l . posner , regional director of the national labor relations board , wrote in an april 7 ruling . this religious acknowledgement goes to the heart of the s separation of church and state . i nstituted a policy the loss of the san diego program is a set - back for cair s desire to take an anti - muslim bullying program national . it represents the biggest government rebuke to cair since the fbiin 2008 to break - off outreach programs due to cair s documented history in a muslim - brotherhood created hamas - support network in the united states . and it should send a message to districts throughout the country , piedra said , warning cair that his organization will sue any public school district that partners with it in a similar anti - bullying program . we want to be sure for the benefit of our schoolchildren that cair is kept out of america s schools , piedra said . if not for the determined parents in san diego , what you see in the video below was on its way to being entrenched in the public schools there , not to mention all around the country in the future as cair planned . see more here : islam in public schools related stories / videos : san diego : more parents demand that cair - sponsored special treatment for muslim students only and islam - teaching in public schools be stopped now this is how designated terrorist group cair , aided and abetted by the school board , is turning san diego schools into sharia - compliant islamic indoctrination centers san diego school board member attacked for policy of forcing students to be indoctrinated with pro - islam propaganda san diego : finally , after 8 years of pleading with parents to stop their schools from indoctrinating children with islamic propaganda , parents are beginning to fight back san diego public school district will create safe spaces for muslims while forcing non - muslim students to learn about islam

not only that , they were assigned to work in groups in which they would simulate a historical hajj ( pilgrimage ) to islam s holiest city mecca ( aka makkah ) in saudi arabia during class . ( gee , i wonder if the teacher told the students that only muslims can enter the city of mecca at any time . no filthy jews or christians allowed , as you can see by the many signs like the one below found in saudi arabia ) fox news all of this was part of a class assignment used in newton public schools to teach about the israeli - palestinian conflict , a new report revealed . one father was particularly upset when he discovered his daughter had been assigned what he described as an inflammatory pro - palestinian , anti - israel article , according to the report . the man was told by the school s principal that lessons the next year would be even more upsetting to him . the class assignment , cities : connecting the islamic word , was published in an excerpt from a book by camera , the committee for accuracy in middle east reporting . as our concluding project on the islamic world , you will work in groups to simulate a historical hajj ( pilgrimage ) to mecca in class , a teacher wrote in the assignment description . each of you will be part of a group of muslim pilgrims from one of the following eight islamic cities or regions , around a rough time period . one of the eight islamic cities is jerusalem , and students are instructed to set up a tent , which will display newspaper articles about their cities and cultural artifacts to represent their islamic hometowns . indoctrinating our youth : how a u . s . public school curriculum skews the arab - israeli conflict and islam the camera report , , is a case study on allegedly biased materials used by newton public schools to teach 9 th and 10 th graders about the israeli - palestinian conflict and islamic history and culture . newton is located about seven miles outside boston , in a middlesex county suburb . citizens of newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now , trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of islam and the israeli - palestinian conflict , judicial watch senior investigator bill marshall told fox news . op - ed marshall detailed his investigation , alongside chairman of citizens for national security dr . bill saxton , in anfor the american thinker . the results of the research compiled by saxton and marshall were used in the camera report . newton parents and residents contacted saxton , who heads cfns , a florida - based research organization that vets textbooks for factual accuracy to get them corrected or removed . saxton spearheaded the two - year effort with marshall at judicial watch to get the release of nearly 600 pages of teaching material from the newton public schools . saxton told fox news the newton school board and superintendent were very uncooperative and non - transparent regarding what was in their textbooks . i m not sure we got everything , saxton said . [ but ] we got so much damning material to go ahead with it . he added : parents and grandparents have absolutely no idea what their children and grandchildren are reading and hearing in school about history and geography . how many of them have read or looked at their textbooks , for example marshall said the teaching materials use as little , if any material on the violent history of islam . in one lesson plan on the spread of islam the teacher s notes indicate muslim conquerors acted decently to their subjects . when you hear so much caterwauling from the left about religion being mixed in the school , it s a little troubling when kids are being asked to go on an imaginary hajj , marshall said . saxton called it an example of a purposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high - schoolers with the virtues of islam at the expense of christianity , judaism and other religions .

the case against a basic income if the payment isn t high enough to let people to refuse work , ubi might push wages down and create more bullshit jobs . in her campaign memoir what happened , hillary clinton wrote that the idea of a universal basic income ( ubi ) for all americans fascinated her . reflecting on her wholly uninspiring campaign , she explained that she wanted to include it in her platform but couldn t make the numbers work , so she dropped the idea . she had planned to call it alaska for america , referring to the alaska permanent fund . established in 1982 , that program gives each of the state s citizens an annual dividend from oil revenues . the idea gained popularity in the mid - sixties , and nixon almost implemented it nationwide . american researchers conducted large - scale experiments in new jersey , and a canadian study took place in winnipeg during the mid - seventies . at the time , the proposal produced heated debates in continental europe and north america , but the decades that followed led to a slow but steady decline in support . the conservative preference for the workfare and activation policies that characterized welfare reform in the nineties led by a different clinton turned basic income into a utopian fantasy . but as interest in ubi from one of the planet s most powerful political figures attests , the last ten years have given new life to the idea . indeed , it s now on the agenda of many movements and governments . for philippe van parijs and yannick vanderborght , two of ubi s leading proponents , the conjunction of growing inequality , a new wave of automation , and a more acute awareness of the ecological limits to growth has made it the object of unprecedented interest throughout the world . the right praises ubi for getting rid of outdated state bureaucracies ; the left for eradicating poverty . finland s right - wing government is testing the idea , replacing part of its unemployment benefits system with a basic income distributed to all finnish citizens . in canada , the government of ontario has been conducting a large - scale experiment since the summer of 2017 . the netherlands has the most developed ubi program experiment in europe . several municipalities are testing the program s effects on its beneficiaries . and in france , the unfortunate socialist candidate for president , beno t hamon , made basic income his key measure . political parties across the globe are now openly discussing the idea of distributing an unconditional income to every citizen . each side of the political spectrum points to different supposed benefits : the right praises ubi for getting rid of outdated state bureaucracies ; the left for eradicating poverty . appearing at once liberal and social , basic income , according to a popular view , divides those who still think about class and the industrial revolution in old - fashioned terms from those who recognize that the knowledge economy has profoundly transformed our economy and society . for this latter group , full employment is utopian , stable work is an outdated demand , and the old institutions of wage labor social security , unions , and so on are obsolete , brakes on progress and individual freedom . for radical left accelerationist theorists nick srnicek and alex williams , basic income constitutes a post - capitalist exit path , while the self - described entrepreneur peter barnes , whose bestseller with liberty and dividends for all inspired hillary clinton , sees it as a way to create a better - balanced capitalism we would call it everyone - gets - a - share capitalism . the studies , experiments , and debates are multiplying , making ubi once again an idea whose time has come . paradoxically , then , ubi seems to be a crisis demand , brandished in moments of social retreat and austerity . as politics moves to the right and social movements go on the defensive , ubi gains ground . the more social gains seem unreachable , the more ubi makes sense . it s what botanists would call a bioindicator : it indexes neoliberalism s progress . support for basic incomes proliferates where neoliberal reforms have been the most devastating . in this sense , ubi isn t an alternative to neoliberalism , but an ideological capitulation to it . in fact , the most viable forms of basic income would universalize precarious labor and extend the sphere of the market just as the gurus of silicon valley hope . the impossibility of a left basic income the question of ubi s economic viability , though basically technical , is vital for determining its political character . that s because ubi s effects depend on the amount distributed and the conditions of its implementation . nick srnicek and alex williams , in their accelerationist manifesto , inventing the future , write that the real significance of ubi lies in the way it overturns the asymmetry of power that currently exists between labour and capital . its establishment would allow workers to have the option to choose whether to take a job or not . a ubi therefore unbinds the coercive aspects of wage labour , partially decommodifies labour , and thus transforms the political relationship between labour and capital . but to do this , the authors insist , it must provide a sufficient amount of income to live on . if the payment isn t high enough to let people to refuse work , ubi might push wages down and create more bullshit jobs . despite the key importance of size and implementation , the countless texts dedicated to establishing a ubi including srnicek and williams s work rarely discuss the policy s concrete details . many of basic income s benefits would only arrive if it provided a generous monthly amount , meaning that a moderate or low - amount version could have potentially negative effects . guy standing , a pioneer of basic income in the united kingdom , currently defends the low - amount version . to advance his proposal , he points to the think tank compass , which produced several micro - simulations to assess the effects and feasibility of the measure in the uk context . compass s study shows the risks of any basic income scheme that tries to replace existing means - tested benefits : such a full scheme would , in its simplest version , give every adult 392 ( 292 ) each month while existing means - tested programs would be abolished . the results would be catastrophic : child poverty would increase by 10 percent , poverty among pensioners by 4 percent , and poverty among the working population by 3 percent . a moderate or low - amount version could have potentially negative effects . compass also analyzed a modified scheme , with a monthly basic income of 284 ( 380 ) for working - age adults ( and smaller payments for others ) that would stand alongside , rather than replace , most existing social programs . but it would also count as income when calculating recipients eligibility for those programs , as well as for tax purposes ; this add - on structure makes the measure less expensive than it would otherwise be , since a large part of the cost is included in existing social spending . but that also dampens the total boost to the net income of the poor . nevertheless , the total cost of this version the amount of new taxes that would be needed is 170 billion or 6 . 5 percent of the uk s gdp . this is the version now promoted by standing . despite the fiscal effort that would go into implementing the new system 6 . 5 percent of gdp , or nearly twice the share of gdp that the us currently spends on its military the results are rather disappointing . child poverty shrinks from 16 to 9 percent , but for working - age people it decreases less than 2 points ( 13 . 9 to 12 percent ) , and among pensioners it declines only 1 point ( 14 . 9 to 14 . 1 percent ) . the considerable sum of money mobilized has only a modest effect on poverty and doesn t specifically benefit those who need it most . as economist ian gough writes , the idea looks like a powerful new tax engine that pull [ s ] along a tiny cart . this fact is even more striking when we consider that the cost of eradicating poverty in any developed country is around 1 percent of gdp . an individual unemployment benefit set at the poverty line ( around 1 , 200 a month ) and granted to all jobless individuals regardless of their place in the family structure would not only pull everyone out of poverty but also end workfare , challenge the normative dimensions of family structures , and fundamentally alter the labor market . all this , for somewhere between six to thirty - five times less money than a universal basic income . the finnish trial s goal is to promote employment by incentivizing people to accept low - paying and low - productivity jobs . the same criticism applies to the moderate version from philippe van parijs , one of the founders of the basic income earth network ( bien ) , which has promoted ubi since the mid - 1980 s . van parijs calls for a base income of 600 ( 710 ) , which , like standing s version , is not fully added to existing social benefits . this program would cost a bit over 6 percent of gdp in a country like belgium , with an already high level of social spending and benefits for a system that fails to increase the meager incomes of the vast majority of people dependent on social services . this is a remarkable fact about a measure so often described as revolutionary a fact made explicit in the finnish trial : it cites its primary goal as being to promote employment by incentivizing people to accept low - paying and low - productivity jobs . of course , we could plead for a more generous version , closer to anticapitalist or accelerationist proposals , like that of french economist yann moulier - boutang . his ubi proposal amounts to 1 , 100 ( 1 , 302 ) a month for each citizen and would be added to existing benefits . in france , it would cost 871 billion , or 35 percent of gdp . when the french socialist party s think tank , fondation jean jaur s , studied the budget impact of a 1000 monthly ubi , it estimated that it would cost as much as all current social spending pensions , unemployment , social assistance , and so on plus the budgets for either national education or health care . suffice it to say , this version is unlikely to see the light of day . moulier - boutang himself acknowledged this , writing that although a detailed balance sheet must still be drawn up , one thing is certain : the current income tax system can only fund a small partial application of this measure . to solve this problem , moulier - boutang suggests replacing the current taxation system ( including progressive income tax ) with a 5 percent tax on financial transactions a fiscal revolution that would reduce the budget deficit while keeping the current level of social spending and adding a ubi of 871 billion euros . the author s rather fantastic calculations sound tempting , but a financial transaction tax could never collect such a large sum . the volume of financial transactions is vast currently ten times gdp but that s precisely because they re not taxed at 5 percent . since financial transactions are typically carried out to achieve profit arbitrages as small as a few tenths of a percent , they would simply cease if we set up moulier - boutang s proposed tax . by way of comparison , the tobin tax , the only financial transaction tax being seriously considered today , is generally envisioned at between 0 . 05 percent and 0 . 2 percent at most one hundred times smaller than moulier - boutang s proposal yet it s specifically designed to reduce speculation ( and thus transactions ) . we would either have to settle for the minimalist version whose effects would be highly suspect or we d have to eliminate all other social expenditures , no existing economy can pay for a generous basic income without defunding everything else . we would either have to settle for the minimalist version whose effects would be highly suspect or we d have to eliminate all other social expenditures , in effect creating milton friedman s paradise . faced with these facts , we should question ubi s rationality ; as luke martinelli put it : an affordable ubi is inadequate , and an adequate ubi is unaffordable . until we profoundly transform our economies , we can t implement a measure that would cost more than 35 percent of gdp in economies where the state already spends around 50 percent of gdp . the power relations needed to establish this level of ubi would constitute an exit from capitalism , pure and simple , rendering depictions of ubi as a means of social transformation nonsense . indeed , many defenses of basic income can be classified as what raymond geuss called nonrealist political philosophy : ideas formulated in complete abstraction from the existing world and real people , completely disjoined from real politics like to the rawlsian model of justice that serves as an important inspiration to figures like philippe van parijs . if ubi does take shape , current power relations will favor those who have economic power and want to profit by weakening the existing system of social protection and labor market regulations . who will decide the monthly amount and who will dictate its terms and condition who do today s power relations favor certainly not the worker . the crisis of work when asked about work , philippe van parijs likes to quote the physician jan pieter kuiper , who launched the debate on basic income in the netherlands in the 1970 s : among my patients there are guys who are sick because they work too much , and guys who are sick because they are unable to find work . this contradiction runs through the history of capitalism , and it motivates van parijs and many of his followers . ubi would create a society in which those who work too much work less , in order to avoid burnout , breathe a little , retrain for new work , or care for their loved ones , and the jobs thus freed up could then be taken by others . that is , it doesn t aim at working less , so all can work , as the workers movement traditionally did , but letting everyone choose how much to work at any given moment . proponents present it as a way to achieve a more harmonious distribution of work . that objective may seem sensible , but it raises several questions . most important , it risks amplifying employers current race to the bottom . today s labor market is highly stratified : some people enjoy access to good jobs while others , subject to harsh competition , can only find precarious and unstable work . a low or moderate ubi too low to let people refuse job offers could relegate the least qualified people to more intensely precarious situations . as luke martinelli puts it : the lack of an exit option for such workers , and their weak bargaining position with respect to employers , means that basic income could end up exacerbating poor pay and conditions if other workers were willing to reduce their wage demands as a result of the unconditional payment . martinelli highlights the danger that basic income would aggravate the problem of low pay and subsidize inefficient employers , leading to a proliferation of lousy jobs . in this scenario , those with good jobs will continue to lead fulfilling lives , now supplemented by universal income , while others will have to combine their ubi with one or more lousy jobs , with little gain in income . the proposal makes no attempt to help those without a job today get one tomorrow or improve the job they have . indeed , everything suggests that the opposite will happen : the ubi will function like a war machine for lowering wages and spreading precarious work . a low or moderate ubi too low to let people refuse job offers could relegate the least qualified people to more intensely precarious situations . this aspect of basic income isn t new : it explains why the neoliberal economist george stigler originally proposed a ubi , in the form of a negative income tax . in contrast to keynes , who downplayed the role of wage levels in his explanation of unemployment , stigler s famous 1946 paper the economics of minimum wage legislation argued that the minimum wage reduced employment . he called on the government to abolish such regulations so that workers could accept wages that don t exceed the market price . stigler s negative income tax , which would supplement incomes up to a certain point , would allow workers to accept low - wage jobs while still living above the poverty line . in effect , the system guarantees a minimum income without affecting the wage price . as friedman wrote in 1956 , the program , while operating through the market , [ does ] not distort the market or impede its functioning , as keynesian programs do . today , one still commonly sees ubi advocates resort to neoclassical platitudes about employment . we can only be astonished , for example , at the dubious claims made by van parijs and vanderborgh in their recent book basic income : a radical proposal for a free society and a sane economy , such as : where the level of remuneration is and remains firmly protected by minimum wage legislation , collective bargaining , and generous employment insurance , the result tends to be massive losses of jobs . we shouldn t be starting from the premise that too - high wages generate unemployment by disrupting the economy s optimal equilibrium : that s precisely the idea we should fiercely challenge . indeed , recent studies seriously undermine these claims . contrary to neoclassical predictions , countries that tax work the most have the highest employment rates because income taxes fund social services , which promote labor market participation , especially for women . who works still , imagine that it was mathematically possible to establish a ubi high enough that none of us would have to work . suppose we could have this generous basic income and still have a strong welfare state . certainly it would be a game changer . yet even this utopia rests on two problematic assumptions work . first , it assumes that unemployed people don t want to work or would be just as happy to receive a generous monthly check . but what if that s wrong the notion that we should reduce the demand for jobs rather than fight for full employment fails to consider that many people do want to work . as seth ackerman has argued , it assumes that the despair expressed by unemployed people amounts to false consciousness , a problem that can be mitigated by propaganda campaigns promoting non - work . this is a faulty explanation of what s at stake with the question of work . there s something deeper at play : work is more than a means for earning money . that s not just due to pro - work ideology , but also to the objective conditions of a society based on a large - scale division of labor in which everyone contributes individually to collective production . this system generates a certain income distribution as well as a certain distribution of work . people are obviously worried about income inequality , but aren t they also worried about job inequality as ackerman writes , so long as social reproduction requires alienated work , there will always be this social demand for the equal liability of all to work , and an uneasy consciousness of it among those who could work but who , for whatever reason , don t . that s why a universal job guarantee and a reduction in work hours still represent the most important objectives for any left politics . collectively reducing work time is politically and socially preferable to creating a socially segmented pool of unemployed workers , a situation that would have serious consequences for the employed . it s not hard to imagine how this situation could foster divisions within the working class as it already has over the last several decades . a universal job guarantee and a reduction in work hours still represent the most important objectives for any left politics . second , such a utopian ubi raises questions about how the distribution of work that is , the division of labor would be determined in a society where we could choose not to work . under capitalism , the division of labor is set in a brutal fashion , relegating large sectors of the population to jobs that are difficult and badly paid , but often of great value to society . a utopian ubi , by contrast , simply assumes that in a society liberated from the work imperative , the spontaneous aggregation of individual desires would yield a division of labor conducive to a properly functioning society ; that the desires of individuals newly freed to choose what they wish to do would spontaneously yield a perfectly functional division of labor . but this expectation is assumed rather than demonstrated . if we want to envision a society where the division of labor is no longer determined through compulsion , then we will have to rethink work itself . and a rethinking of work will only point in an emancipatory direction if work is made more meaningful and attractive . in a society where the nature of work is profoundly unequal not only in its distribution but also in its content transforming it becomes fundamental . cash or decommodification beyond arguments of feasibility or the effects on the labor market , we need to ask a more fundamental question : is distributing 1 , 100 to the whole population the best use of 35 percent of gdp isn t the best way to fight against capitalism to limit the sphere in which it operates establishing a base income , by contrast , merely allows everyone to participate in the market . our current economic crisis goes beyond the problem of income inequality . while inequality garners the most attention , it s a secondary feature of capitalism . one of capitalism s most remarkable achievements ( but also one of its most violent ) is that it made market exchange the nearly exclusive means to acquire the goods necessary for our own reproduction . in doing so , it turned money into almost the only valid medium of exchange and it made the majority of the population dependent on capital , enforcing a fundamentally asymmetric power relation between the boss and the worker . this profoundly unequal relationship not only subordinates people within the sphere of labor , but outside it as well , through the powerful influence economic power exerts on politics , ideology , and culture . equality isn t possible without restricting the freedom of competitive markets , without opening socialized spaces free from market imperatives . by the end of the nineteenth century , leftists understood this problem perfectly well . the welfare state tried to limit the areas in which the market and economic power could operate . if industrialization had made only owners full citizens with real rights , then social security and unemployment insurance established what robert castel called social property , marking the emergence of a new function of the state , of a new form of rights , and a new conception of property . as the british sociologist t . h . marshall explained , equality isn t possible without restricting the freedom of competitive markets , without opening socialized spaces free from market imperatives . in other words , for the left , the economic effects of extending the market ( as well as the political and cultural effects ) were never divorced from a questioning of the logic of the market itself . though this perspective has suffered enormous setbacks since the early 1970 s , it still offers a vision radically different from our current neoliberal consensus . the ultimate aim is not to make competition more fair , less discriminatory , or less normative . instead , it seeks to curtail the space in which competition exists . in this sense , freedom doesn t signify the ability to access the market , but rather the ability to reduce the space in which it operates . hillary clinton was right to say that she underestimated the power of big ideas . but that doesn t mean ubi is the big idea we need . we should reconnect with the postwar period s emancipatory heritage . the institutions workers established after world war ii did more than stabilize or buffer capitalism . they constituted , in embryonic form , the elements of a truly democratic and egalitarian society , where the market would not have the central place it now occupies . and if the recent successes of bernie sanders and jeremy corbyn are anything to go by , the door may now be open to a rebirth of socialist politics . utopia is not beyond our reach it s closer than we think . daniel zamora is a postdoctoral sociologist at the universit libre de bruxelles and cambridge university . translation by jeff bate boerop . this article previously appeared in jacobin and portside
view gallery if you re like me , you clicked on this just to figure out what the heck i mean by jersey insurance . for clarification purposes , i am not talking about new jersey but sports jerseys . fanatics which is the 1 selling sports jersey company in the u . s . has offered a new deal to its customers . the deal is if you get a jersey and that player changes teams within three months of you getting the jersey you can swap it with their new jersey or for another players jersey on the original team for free you have two weeks from the time the player is moved to do this , but holy crap is this a great idea we found out that 25 percent of fans were worried that the jerseys they purchase would become obsolete , said co - president of fanatics direct - to - consumer business . so by doing this , this is a major paint point we are solving . this philosophy soft opened earlier in the nfl season when saints fans returned their adrian peterson jerseys after he was traded to the cardinals after just a handful of weeks . 90 of the fans returned their jerseys for another saints player , but this new philosophy made them more likely to continue purchasing jerseys . i have personally stopped buying jerseys of current players because i have what i call a jersey curse and it doesn t matter which sport either . here s an example of my jersey curse over the years : tiki barber , retired two month after i got it . brandon jacobs , released a month later . kevin boss , released three weeks later . ray rice , abused his wife adrian peterson , abused his son . antonio pierce , retired at the end of the year . calvin johnson , added the jr . at the end a few months after i bought his jersey ryan callahan , traded a week after i got his jersey . so because of all of that i now have two things , i have a closet full of jerseys i never wear and a fear of buying a jersey of my favorite player because they all either get traded , released , retire or do something awful that i can no longer wear their jersey . i have always wanted a landon collins jersey from the second they drafted him , but i can t get it because i feel like if i get his jersey , he ll leave . this new deal is awesome , and jersey lovers around the country should be ecstatic that they can now purchase jerseys without fear jersey fanatics stand up and check out this sweet deal that fanatics is offering and don t be afraid to buy that jersey now that you re insured
megyn kelly and actor jane fonda started a feud in september when the actor appeared on the new nbc morning show . fonda was promoting her movie our souls at night , co - starring robert redford . now , kelly has gone hard after the older woman carried on with a poor me routine . at the time , nbc s host of megyn kelly toDay asked fonda about her own plastic surgery : i read that you said that you felt you re not proud to admit you ve had work done . why not clearly , kelly hit a nerve with fonda who replied : we really wanna talk about that now since then , fonda has taken shots at kelly . she recently told variety she would only appear on megyn kelly today again if she learns her stuff . kelly had enough of fonda , and she hit back hard with a full segment and a large audience . the morning show host did not pull punches in her response , explaining that she previously wanted to ignore fonda s criticisms . yet , now she was ready to directly confront the issue . she said that the older woman appeared on her show to promote her film about aging : now , a word on jane fonda , who appears to be fixated on an exchange i had with her months ago on this show . it s time to address the poor me routine . for years she has spoke about the joy of giving a cultural face to older women . the truth is , most older women look nothing like fonda , who is now 80 . and if fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women s cultural face , then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore . the nbc host noted that fonda had often discussed her cosmetic surgery : pretty much everywhere . when she came here , however , again to promote her film about aging , i was supposed to discern that this subject was suddenly off limits . kelly had no regrets about her question and went on with a serious assault on fonda s past controversial statements : i have no regrets about that question , nor am i in the market for a lesson from jane fonda on what is and is not appropriate . this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage . look at her treatment of military during the vietnam war . many of our veterans still call her hanoi jane , thanks to her radio broadcast which attempted to shame american troops . kelly continued her response : she posed on an anti - aircraft gun used to shoot down our american pilots . she called our p . o . w . s hypocrites and liars and referred to their torture as understandable . even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture . but not for the rest of it . by the way she says she is not proud of america . so , the moral indignation is a little much . she put her plastic surgery out there . fonda appeared at the sundance film festival , where reporters asked if she would go back on kelly s show . fonda went back to her buzz phrase , variety reported : sure . it wasn t like i was upset . i was stunned . it was so inappropriate . it showed that she s not that good an interviewer . but if she comes around and learns her stuff , sure . featured image via getty images / monica schipper .
an h m monkey sweatshirt s messaging recently came under fire , receiving so much backlash , the company removed the item completely from their inventory and singer the weeknd ended his partnership with the brand . the mother of the black child who modeled the shirt for the company s ad , reading coolest monkey in the jungle , however , doesn t believe it s racially insensitive and believes that people should get over it . the child s mother , terry mango , from stockholm , sweden , took to facebook to express her opinion about the outcry over the ad , writing : am the mum and this is one of hundreds of outfits my son has modeled . she added : stop crying wolf all the time , unnecessary issue here get over it . if i bought that jumper and put it on him and posted it on my pages , would that make me racist i get people s opinion , but they are not mine . mango also explained that she has been to her son s photo shoots and was there when he wore this hoodie . she noted : everyone is entitled to their opinion about this i really don t understand but not because i am choosing not to but because it s not my way of thinking , sorry . h m has apologized for the hoodie and photo , saying in a statement : we re deeply sorry that the picture was taken , and we also regret the actual print . therefore , we ve not only removed the image from our channels , but also the garment from our product offering . it s obvious that our routines haven t been followed properly . this is without any doubt . we ll thoroughly investigate why this happened to prevent this type of mistake from happening again . basketball star lebron james was among many who voiced their dismay over the shirt , writing in a post : we as african americans will always have to break barriers , prove people wrong and work even harder to prove we belong but guess what , that s what we love because the benefits at the end of the road are so beautiful many people weighed in with comments on the b . scott facebook post about the controversy , with one person explaining : it s not our job to protect this child s image . that s what his parents are for . if people took more time to cultivate their OwN gardens , meaning the world directly in your path , then we wouldn t be so inclined to try and save and protect a stranger because we re too busy tending to our own . color and sharing a race doesn t qualify us to protect one another . another commenter pointed out that perhaps this isn t as much of an issue for the mother , as she s not american . this is just a little something to think about : well she did say everyone is entitled to their opinion . as in the article , she may not be in a country where the racial climate is as serious as it is in america , so i can see how she really isn t seeing the issue , money or not . but hey the conversation it has created has been good .
we ve heard of women who try their darndest to look like barbie dolls . some have been known to go to the extent of having major surgeries to alter their bodies in a way that will get them closer to the physical features of the tall , blonde doll with a tiny waist and curvy bust and hips . but there is another woman who is just as dedicated to her look just as much as all the barbie doll lovers out there . her name is jade smith and she is on a mission to look exactly like a porcelain doll . proving that she will spare no expense , jade has already spent 18 , 000 to get her on the way to looking like the real life lolita . her doll - like outfits alone have cost her 10 , 000 and they consist of items such as a frilly pink dress with knee - high socks and a furry pink headband that wraps around her hair . lolita s hair is platinum blonde and she has a set of full eyelashes which are another costly thing that needs to be maintained in order to keep up with the appearance . jade has set certain budgets aside for monthly spending to stay on track with her appearance . for example , she has a 20 glitter budget . evidently , lolita has some sparkly attire . she has gone so far as to wear contact lenses that aren t needed . she wears them so that they expand the shape of her eyes , making her look even more like lolita . at times , she gets up at 4 am to get ready and make sure she has her look perfected . seems like a lot of work and money to keep up with trying to look like someone else , but jade is truly obsessed . i ve spent around 10 , 000 just on my clothes , said jade . i normally get my clothing shipped in from japan and korea . the clothes and makeup aren t the only things that jade needs to look like lolita , though . she has loads of accessories that go along with the character . i have roughly around 40 pairs of shoes and i have around 40 key chains . the money has also gone into my toy collection . you would never guess that jade is an adult if you walked into her room . she has a care - bear lined bed and shelves that house dolls , disney characters , hello kitty and my little pony figurines . the room is covered in pink , looking much more like a little girl s than a grown adults . jade , who lives in her parent s home in a loft , gets a grief from her family occasionally . my family calls me a hoarder and they really wish i would downsize and become more minimalistic , said jade . they wish i would wear something a bit normal but they just accept me for who i am now . jade admits that she would wear head to toe pink every day but her retail assistant job keeps her from doing so . instead , she has to accessorize with pink and wear mostly black when she is on the job . i got in trouble once at work for dressing differently . i have over 20 keychains on my phone and my phone fell out of my pocket during a shift . the only casual clothing i own is jeggings , which i wear for work , she said . in the future , jade plans on taking it up a notch and going for surgery to get her even closer to the lolita look .
oops . a hamas leader , co - founder and senior official imad al - alami , made a critical error while inspecting his weapon : he shot himself in the head . this is the same man who the bbc notes is a specially designated global terrorist . al - alami is in critical condition after the accidental shooting , as a report from the times of israel explains : senior hamas official imad al - alami , who is a key link between gaza and tehran , was shot in the head tuesday morning , with the terror group s spokesperson fawzi barhoum saying he accidentally discharged his own weapon while inspecting it . hamas - run gaza health ministry spokesperson dr . ashraf al - qidre said al - alami is being treated at the intensive care unit in gaza city s shifa hospital and that his condition is critical . al - alami , also known as abu hamam , was born in gaza in 1956 . he was one of the founders of hamas , which controls the gaza strip , and served as the terror group s main representative in tehran for many years before moving to damascus in 2008 . according to another report , from haaretz , however , al - alami was hospitalized after an assassination attempt . those commenting on the story on ilJ . com noted : should happen more often , lead by example . plEasE , and it truly is a shame he is still breathing . another person noted : i think i d rather it be known as an assassination attempt than that i shot myself in the head with my own gun one commenter tried to explain this possibility : presumably , it was an aK - 47 . the full auto versions have a design flaw that can cause an accidental discharge when dissembling it if there is still a round in the chamber . on various facebook posts about the accidental shooting story , people weighed in with comments such as : this is reminding me of the old story of the terrorist who blew himself up because he forgot to set the timer on his bomb to reflect a change in time zones . another person added : it couldn t have happened to a better person i encourage more terrorists to do the same . some commenters weren t buying the accidental shooting story , however , with commenter presenting this idea , and citing fake news : when cleaning a gun you have to take out the clip , and pull back the slide to remove the built in the chamber . you then pull down on release clip to disconnect the chamber from the gun body . these are standard pre - cleaning moves on an automatic handgun . this guy was shot by somebody else . this is a fake news story another added this reasoning of an assassination attempt : he came from syria to gaza to organize the local hamas . he was probably interfering too much in the local corrupted business of the leaders of this terrorist organization . he is not the first that has received local assistance to take an early journey to the moslem paradise . one commenter noted : who inspects his personal weapon oUtsidE his residence maybe that ll be one more to scratch off the hit list . i sure hope so . another commenter offered this helpful gun safety tip : rule 1 when cleaning your gun : make sure it s not loaded .
when paul servat learned that his girlfriend was pregnant , he committed to changing his life for the better . he wanted to be prepared to be a fantastic father , so he put all his energy into making that come true . he was by his girlfriend barbara bienvenue s side as soon as she told him the good news . servat was exuberant . he had always wanted to bring a life into the world and prove himself as a dad . during the summer , the pair had met online like many couples do these days . and just two months into their infatuated relationship , bienvenue told servat that he had gotten her pregnant . that was in september . and he took the news like a champ . after she went to an appointment with her doctor a few weeks later , she told him they were having twins only to revise her position and tell him they were having triplets . then they were expecting quadruplets . and finally , they settled on having quintuplets . through it all , servat did not question bienvenue . often doctors struggle to identify how many babies are gestating when there is a multiple births . while the idea of raising five babies terrified servat , he remained optimistic and forward focuses . he was proving to the world that he had what it took to be a wonderful dad . he did the right thing . servat helped pick out the babies names . and he even told his parents and encouraged them to get excited about meeting their grandchildren . because raising five babies is intimidating , the local community started to help . they began donating items and money to help servat and bienvenue raise five children . servat purchased five cribs and waited for the little ones to come into the world so he could prove how much he loved them . eventually , the day came when bienvenue was ready to deliver the babies . then a nurse pulled servat aside and whispered a horrible secret to the expectant father . there were no babies . bienvenue was not even pregnant . that s when the hospital made a strong decision . bienvenue did not need to be in the maternity ward . she needed to be in the psychiatric ward . servat was utterly confused and hurt . her lies broke his spirit and made him feel so low . i lost everything , it was my whole life , servat told the toronto sun . his dreams of becoming a father were quashed from the beginning . his girlfriend had not truly been pregnant . as for the items that were received from members of the community , bienvenue said they would return or donate them . i ll return all these things to people who sent them or give them ( away ) . i m a good person , and i have nothing to do with these lies , she stated . bienvenue suffered from a condition known as pseudocyesis . she truly believes that she was pregnant . she even suffered from lactation , morning sickness , and abdominal swelling . the mind is truly a powerful thing . we hope servat one day experiences the joy of fatherhood . based on how he responded to this situation , we suspect he ll make a wonderful dad .
ruth bader ginsburg ( rbg ) is something of a hero to women across the country . the supreme court justice is one of the pioneers of the court and continues to be one of the most relevant people in the legal system . ginsburg , 84 , has a rigorous workout and maintains her schedule . recently , saturday night live actor , kate mckinnon , portrayed her , and the justice enjoyed it . during a sundance cinema talks conversation , people wondered how much longer she could carry on with her vital job as a liberal justice . she said thanks for asking , according to the los angeles times : as long as i can do the job full steam , i will be here . she joined the supreme court in 1993 . democrats are concerned that should she leave the court , donald trump would fill the seat with a more conservative man and make the court right - leaning heavy . the earliest she could leave the supreme court would be 2021 , at age 88 , but she does not plan to step down even then . rbg has law clerks staffed through the court s 2020 term . when justice ruth bader ginsburg started her legal career , it was a different world . at the sundance film festival , she spoke about the metoo movement , npr reported : it s about time . for so long women were silent , thinking there was nothing you could do about it , but now the law is on the side of women , or men , who encounter harassment and that s a good thing . so far it s been great . when i see women appearing every place in numbers , i m less worried about a backlash than i might have been 20 years ago . ginsburg recalled times she experienced sexism as a student and a teacher : every woman of my vintage knows what sexual harassment is , although we didn t have a name for it . she asked a cornell chemistry instructor for a practice exam , but he gave her a copy of the real one : i knew exactly what he wanted in return . ( i ) went to his office and said , how dare you how dare you do this and that was the end of that . when ginsburg was at columbia law school , the school laid off 25 women in the maintenance department , but not one man . rbg headed to the university s vice president for business to tell him that the school was violating title Vii . he told her : professor ginsburg , columbia has excellent wall street lawyers representing them and would you like a cup of tea ginsburg had two children at the same time she was founding the aclU women s right s project and working as a columbia professor . in addition , she litigated cases across the country and before the supreme court . one day she got a call from her son james school : . the child was what his teachers called hyperactive and i called lively . ( after a call from the school , she said ) this child has two parents . please alternate calls . it s his father s turn . the justice said : the calls came barely once a semester and the reason was they had to think long and hard before asking a man to take time out of his work day to come to the school . the remarkable thing about marty ( her husband professor ginsburg ) is that he cared that i had a brain . no guy up until then was the least interested in how i thought . featured image via getty images / robin marchant .
special counsel robert mueller has begun talking to senior people in the donald trump administration . now , attorney general jeff sessions is in the special counsel s sights . the ag recused himself from the russia investigation last march , because he was involved in the trump campaign . what did sessions tell mueller the special counsel questioned him for several hour trump expected sessions to have his back , apparently not understanding that the justice department operates independently . during sessions confirmation hearings with congress , he did not disclose that he met two times with the russian ambassador to the u . s . , sergey kislyah , during the campaign . the ag was one of the first trump campaign supporters . mueller would be interested in a potential obstruction of justice . trump fired former fbi director , james comey , after he refused to drop the investigation into then national security adviser , michael flynn . since then , flynn has turned state s evidence against the trump administration . sessions was involved with the letter trump wanted about comey , which was part of the former fbi director s firing . normally , the special counsel saves the top - level interviews for the end of an investigation , but this has been anything but normal . a justice department spokesperson , sarah isgur flores , confirmed that sessions had been interviewed , according to the new york times . this was the first time that mueller s team interviewed a member of the trump cabinet . featured image via getty images / chip somodevilla .
it ' s a surprising moment of legitimate journalism . on june 8 th , 1965 , during the six - day war , israel attacked and nearly sank the Uss liberty belonging to its closest ally , the Usa . thirty - four american servicemen were killed and over 170 wounded in the two - hour assault by israeli warplanes and torpedo boats . israel claimed that the whole affair had been a tragic accident based on mistaken identification of the ship . the american government accepted the explanation . for more than 30 years many people have disbelieved the official explanation but have been unable to rebut it convincingly . now , " dead in the water " uses startling new evidence to reveal the truth behind the seemingly inexplicable attack . the film combines dramatic reconstruction of the events , with new access to former officers in the Us and israeli armed forces and intelligence services who have decided to give their own version of events . interviews include president lyndon johnson ' s secretary of defense , robert mcnamara , former head of the israeli navy , admiral shlomo errell , and members of the Uss liberty crew . more on this story at : < URL >
a danish school has drawn nationwide outage after it moved to cancel its traditional christmas service out of respect for children of other faiths ( aka muslims ) . students at gribskolen in graested traditionally gather for a service at the local church before christmas . the school board has informed parents that the tradition will be scrapped since not all students are christians . ( never was a problem before there were muslims in the school ) sputniknews danish radio this decision came under a storm of criticism from danish netizens and politicians alike , reported . the two main points of criticism are that canceling christmas service undermines a long - standing danish tradition and constitutes taking a knee to islam , as the very same school last year held a syrian week ( below ) during which pupils learned about the muslim faith and the holy month of ramadan , tried syrian food and danced syrian dances , the den korte avis outlet reported . the decision to cancel christmas service was taken in the spring , yet only reached the public now when the parents were first informed about the decision . this is completely askew . you must not cancel your traditions as misunderstood attention to some students , education minister merete riisager said . wrote . prime minister lars l kke rasmussen , who comes from gr sted , put forth his views regarding the issue on facebook . this needs a do - over , l kke rasmussen gribskolen board leader charlotte orland pedersen , however , was disappointed by the public s reaction . she pointed out that at least eight different faiths are represented among the pupils , stressing that the christmas service was not dropped specifically for the sake of muslim students . ( yes , it was ) by her own admission , she has not heard of any parents who complained about the decision . school director association chairman claus hjortdal argued that there was nothing wrong with dropping the traditional service for the sake of muslim students . however , local parish priest ole backer mogensen called it overdramatizing to use the word preaching in connection with the christmas service . ( in islam , that means only between muslims ) , finding a homes in the midst of rootlessness and so forth , ole backer mogensen wrote in an opinion piece in the local if christmas is reduced to s ren the banjo mouse [ a popular danish christmas song for kids ] , there won t be any room left toaddress some of the deeper themes around christmas , such as promoting peace and goodness between people , finding a homes in the midst of rootlessness and so forth , ole backer mogensen wrote in an opinion piece in the local netavisen newspaper .
former fBi director james comey s original memo regarding former secretary of state hillary clinton s private email server was edited by fBi staffers to remove five references suggesting clinton engaged in activities that would suggest felony and misdemeanor charges , according to obtained copies of the original memo . the original comey memo concluded that it was reasonably likely that clinton s private server was accessed or hacked by hostile entities , adding that there was no evidence to prove that assertion . fBi subordinates changed that characterization to the weaker it was possible . the document also details that on five separate occasions the memo was altered from terms such as grossly negligent , which would imply evidence supporting felony and misdemeanor crimes , to the more innocuous extremely careless . the department of justice ( dOj ) has launched a new investigation into the clinton foundation , as reported by the hill on thursday night . the full draft and edits of the documents was released on the senate homeland and government affairs committee by chairman ron johnson ( r - wi ) , and reveals the most detailed account of the former fBi director s original draft . the full draft of the comey memo suggests that comey originally wrote in may 2016 that there was evidence that former secretary of state clinton and her aides may have violated felony and misdemeanor statutes . hffowever , the memo also argues that he probably could not prove intent before a jury . comey wrote , although there is evidence of potential violations of the statute proscribing gross negligence in the handling of classified information and of the statute proscribing misdemeanor mishandling , my judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case . the fBi explained to congress that the edits were made by staffers to comey and then accepted by the former fBi director before he announced later in july 2016 that he would not pursue criminal charges against hillary clinton . chairman johnson sent a letter to fBi director christopher wray , asking why significant edits were made to comey s draft and if the edits were part of a scheme to protect clinton from the political ramifications of a more serious judgment from the fBi . johnson explained , the edits to director comey s public statement , made months prior to the conclusion of the fBi s investigation of secretary clinton s conduct , had a significant impact on the fBi s public evaluation of the implications of her actions . this effort , seen in light of the personal animus toward then - candidate trump by senior agents leading the clinton investigation and their apparent desire to create an insurance policy against mr . trump s election , raise profound questions about the fBi s role and possible interference in the 2016 presidential election , sen . johnson added . comey s original memo also suggested that he had worked with other intelligence agencies to ascertain whether clinton s private email server damaged matters of national security . comey wrote in the original memo , we have done extensive work with the assistance of our colleagues elsewhere in the intelligence community to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the private email operation . comey s coordination with the intelligence community was deleted from the official comey memo . president donald trump tweeted on january 2 , crooked hillary clinton s top aide , huma abedin , has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols . she put classified passwords into the hands of foreign agents . remember sailors pictures on submarine jail deep state justice dept must finally act also on comey others .
despite the claim of iranian revolutionary guard officials that they have squashed the protests in iran , they are still massive . the regime is trying to stop the information about them from getting out by cutting off the social media in the country . but the protesters , who are very appreciative of the supportive words of president donald trump are in desperate need of communications to continue to get the word out . from fox news : here is real hell , a 31 - year - old protest leader in tehran , who fox news will identify only as azi , said in a telephone interview during the early hours of wednesday morning . this is a real revolution against the mullahs . iran is uprising . i thank mr . trump for his support , but we need more . president trump has taken to twitter several times to note the protests in iran , and on wednesday morning hinted the u . s . could become more involved in due time . such respect for the people of iran as they try to take back their corrupt government . you will see great support from the united states at the appropriate time the protests were precipitated by iran s bad economy , pervasive corruption and the escalating cost of fuel and goods . the people also were disturbed that they hadn t seen any of the promised benefits of the iran deal . the push is mainly coming from younger iranians who see no economic prospects and are not happy with the clerical rule of the mullahs . they organized through social media such as instagram and telegram . so the government tried to stop it by shutting them down . but it s not stopping . obama betrayed the iranian people . he gave the mullahs are ransom and cooperated with ( supreme leader ) khamenei , he betrayed the syrian people too . but trump did not . so we have real expectations , said azi . we want sanctions against the iranian regime . they plundered our money . the u . s should not pay the mullahs . azi said he doesn t know the fate of friends who have been arrested in the ongoing demonstrations . but he assured they are prepared to fight until the bitter end . this time , even if we die , we will not stop . this is the price of freedom . we are not afraid , he vowed . i am a freedom fighter . maybe tonight i will be killed . fox news noted that on a recent trip to iran there were people with multiple degrees forced to be cab drivers and waiters to survive . we had hope in rouhani , much more than ahmadinejad , one waiter whispered . but our lives are no better yet . they made it very clear that their purpose is not just economic , but it is political and they want to throw out the mullahs . the issue is not just economic , it is political . people will give many reasons for protesting , and all the reasons have led to us losing patience , said nik , a 27 - year - old engineering student in tehran . all the money given in the iran deal went to expand security forces in syria and lebanon , all the people know this . we will continue until we overthrow this regime . we thank mr . trump for support , but we need all the countries not to remain silent . others on the ground in iran told fox news most of the protest participants are young people many students of universities , along with a number of high schoolers and supporters of the mek opposition group . another protester , a 23 - year - old communications student named haroon , concurred the bulk of protesters were fellow students fed up with their dim prospects . students and ordinary people are being killed and wounded police , he insisted . because we tear down posters of the tyrannical leaders and we burn them . we only want happiness . we want help from the americans to end this regime . after hearing the supportive words from trump and such people as un ambassador nikki haley , it generated a lot of positive reaction in iran . suddenly the country famous for the government - dictated death to america chants were commenting viva iran , viva usa , viva trump and proud of you president trump that strongly support the people . but it s not going to come easily . at least 21 people have already been killed and hundreds arrested . haroon said that despite that the protests continue to grow . nik said that women had a special role in this because they were pushing for equal rights . there has been a debate about how involved the u . s . should be and in what way , some believing that u . s . involvement would be used against the protesters by the government against the protesters . some encouraged the u . s . to at least help with getting the word out with internet coverage . amir fakhravar , president of the iranian freedom institute , described the protesters . they love president trump . they will love him more if he can do something to make sure we will have internet coverage , satellite coverage all over iran [ to get the story out ] . he said it was huge , involving millions of people , but they need the coverage to be able to communicate . fakhravar said they could be the army of the world to free it from the small group of fanatic mullahs . if the protesters won and were able to throw out the mullahs [ clerical leadership ] , it would change the face of the middle east away from their extremism and export of terrorism . others also echoed that thought . president trump needs to get behind this situation , just as we did with various regime changes in the fall of the soviet union , contended james waurishuk , a retired u . s . air force colonel and former trump campaign advisor . the u . s . needs to bolster its strategic influence and public diplomacy efforts . according to farjam behnam , founder of the iranian affairs site iran almanaC , president trump s support is widely appreciated , but people need practical action . free high - speed internet would be a great first step , he said . former ambassador john bolton made a great point . if the people on the ground are calling for this help , they are the ones who know best what will help and what will harm their cause , not liberal media in the united states . in 2009 , barack obama was faced with the same choice . at least help with the social media . he refused and the revolution failed . he even refused to have the Cia involved in any way whatsoever . let s not make that same mistake again .
hillary clinton might still be wondering what happened as far as losing the election goes , and now , her and former president bill clinton s foundation is under investigation by the fbI . as clinton has been tweeting her concerns over families worrying about their children having health care , fbI agents in little rock , arkansas , have been delving into the clinton foundation . so what s going on the fbI is looking into whether the clintons did any favors for donors who contributed to their organization . on thursday , the hill reported : the justice department has launched a new inquiry into whether the clinton foundation engaged in any pay - to - play politics or other illegal activities while hillary clinton served as secretary of state , law enforcement officials and a witness tells the hill . fbI agents from little rock , ark . , where the foundation was started , have taken the lead in the investigation and have interviewed at least one witness in the last month , and law enforcement officials said additional activities are expected in the coming weeks . the officials , who spoke only on condition of anonymity , said the probe is examining whether the clintons promised or performed any policy favors in return for largesse to their charitable efforts or whether donors made commitments of donations in hopes of securing government outcomes . fox news confirmed the report from the hill on thursday evening , via the twitter account of special report : fox news can confirm the department of justice has launched a new investigation into hillary clinton . a source < URL > special report team ( specialreport ) january 5 , 2018 clinton s spokesperson , nick merrill , called the news a sham on friday , adding that republicans have tried to turn the foundation into a political football . clinton herself has yet to offer a comment about the investigation . however , this isn t the former presidential nominee s first time being investigated by the fbI .
president donald trump ignored a reporter s question friday on whether former adviser steve bannon should be fired from breitbart . bannon told author michael wolff that he believes donald trump jr . committed treason by arranging a meeting in trump tower with a russian lawyer . those comments and trump s responses have dominated the news cycle this week . leaving the white house for a weekend at camp david with republican leaders , trump stopped for a moment to give a brief statement to the press in a bitter 5 degree wind chill . i m going over with the senators , he said . we re going to camp david . we have a lot of things to work on , a lot of things to accomplish . the stock market is up very , very big today . we ve set new records , and i think they ll be continued to set . the tax cuts are really kicking in far beyond what anyone thought , he continued . numerous companies have today come out and announced they re going to make big payments to their employees , something that nobody really had in mind , so we are very honored by it . but the market is good . the jobs reports were very good , and we think they are going to get really good over the next couple of months . so again , we re going to camp david with a lot of the great republican senators , and we are making america great again . thank you , thank you very much . on his way to a waiting marine one helicopter , a reporter yelled loudly at trump : should steve bannon should be fired trump continued walking toward the aircraft , looking at the reporters with this expression on his face : then , he smirked just a bit . fox news host dana perino said on her show immediately after trump s departure that he usually is willing to take some questions from reporters but i have to tell you that the former communications person it was smart of him not to do such a thing .

errol parker editor - at - large contact two largely incompetent grade - cricketers living under the illusion they know what they re talking about have once again argued over whether current australian test captain steve smith is the next bradman . lewis thompson and eddy george both enjoying playing the game and they often contribute to online cricketing forums , where they have knowledge imparted upon them as well as imparting theirs on others . in a word , they re both seasoned cricket followers . but with all that prestige , the pair cannot agree on whether the world is watching another don develop before their eyes or if steve smith is simply another run - of - the - mill tendulkar . granted nobody will ever retire with an average even close to bradman , said george . they play more games now and it s a different game altogether . therefore , it s impossible to compare the two . bradman might have well played french cricket the games are so different but lewis disagrees . he thinks steve smith , a man who was once selected as a leg - spin bowling all - rounder , will not only be the next bradman he thinks he ll better . don t get me wrong , bradman is the best ever . i don t take that away from him , but he wouldn t be able to compete in the modern game . imagine if he had dale steyn coming at him around the wicket with a bit of fire in his belly he d be like a little lamb at the abattoir , smith has proven himself to be the greatest batsman in the modern game , which is tougher and harder than the old one . one ill - informed opinion after another flowed until the change of innings concluded and they both went back to watching the game . more to come .

after mr . trump made the most vile racist comments during an oval office meeting on immigration thursday , many people are speaking out about his use of vulgar language and racist attitude , which is anything but fitting for the president of the united states . trump s reference to haiti , el salvador , and african nations as shithole countries has made quite a stir throughout the u . s . and the rest of the world . trump said : why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here trump went on to ask why we don t bring in more immigrants from countries like norway . trump tried to dispute the remarks but senators lindsey graham ( r - sc ) and dick durbin ( d - il ) were both present at the meeting and confirmed what was said . on saturday night , robin bell , founder of bell visuals , finally had enough and decided mr . trump s washington d . c . hotel is the real shithole . he projected the word shithole along with the poop emoji right on to the property for all to see . other phrases projected on to the building were pay trump bribes here emoluments welcome , and we are all responsible to stand up and end white supremacy . bell is becoming famous for already having done similar things . back in may , he projected messages onto the d . c . hotel , but this has to be his best work yet . this is what twitter had to say : featured image by mark wilson / getty images
mr . trump has plenty of critics these days , and rightfully so . however , there are still many republicans who are unwilling to break ranks and call him out for his horrible assault on the united states and the rest of the world . one senator is using some harsh words now to describe the man in the oval office . senator jeff flake ( r - az ) went on msnbc last night for an interview where he blasted trump , comparing him to the communist dictator , josef stalin of the soviet union . flake was present at the meeting where trump referred to haiti , el salvador , and african nations as shithole countries . according to the washington post , senator flake s office has released excerpts of a speech he plans to give on wednesday , where he is going to tell the american people that trump s assault on the constitutionally - protected free press is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted . according to the post : flake continues to be one of trump s most frequent critics , often speaking out to warn that the president s words and actions could be detrimental to the future of the republican party and the nation s standing worldwide . in his speech , flake plans to say : it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by josef stalin to describe his enemies . it bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people , that even nikita khrushchev forbade its use , telling the soviet communist party that the phrase had been introduced by stalin for the purpose of annihilating such individuals who disagreed with the supreme leader . flake will also say that trump : has it precisely backward despotism is the enemy of the people . the free press is the despot s enemy , which makes the free press the guardian of democracy . when a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn t suit him fake news , it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion , not the press . flake had strong words on msnbc on sunday night , referring to not only stalin and mao zedong , but the media as the enemy of the people . flake said : i don t think that we should be using a phrase that s been rejected as too loaded by a soviet dictator . in 2012 , flake was elected to the senate and announced he will not seek a second term in november . the list of republicans running to succeed him are former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio , representative martha mcsally , and former state senator kelli ward . whoever wins the primary will face democratic candidate representative kyrsten sinema ( az ) in the general election . another excerpt posted by flake s office reads : 2017 was a year which saw the truth objective , empirical , evidence - based truth more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country , at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government . it was a year which saw the white house enshrine alternative facts into the american lexicon , as justification for what used to be known simply as good old - fashioned falsehoods . it was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally - protected free press was launched by that same white house , an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted . the enemy of the people , was what the president of the united states called the free press in 2017 . twitter also cheered on flake : featured image by richard baker via getty images

" my perception was that he was encouraged by that message , " he told reporters . the two leaders also discussed how to deal with americans imprisoned by egypt and also about terrorism and north korea ' s nuclear program . however , u . s . reporters and a pence aide were initially not allowed to leave their van at the presidential palace in cairo , according to the journal . with the help of colleagues outside , pence ' s aide was finally able to enter the palace . and only after pence raised the issue directly with sisi did the egyptians later allow the press to take pictures and listen to brief remarks . in jordan , pence and king abdullah " emphasized the strength of the strategic jordanian u . s . relationship as well the role the u . s . plays in ensuring regional stability , " according to the jordanian embassy in washington , d . c . " they also discussed efforts to end the syrian crisis as well as the importance of international cooperation in efforts to bring a political solution to this crisis . both sides also discussed efforts to revive the palestinian israeli peace process and means to bring both sides back to the negotiation table , " the embassy said in a statement . abdullah had warned against declaring jerusalem israel ' s capital . pence ' s middle east trip will end in israel , where he will meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu and address the israeli legislature as well as visit the western wall . pence will not meet palestinian leaders . the office of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas had also said he would not meet with pence during his visit to the west bank " because the u . s . has crossed red lines " on jerusalem . trump announced last month that the u . s . will be beginning a process to move its embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem , and officially recognize the city as israel ' s capital . " while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise , they failed to deliver . today , i am delivering , " he said at the time . the status of jerusalem has been up for dispute for centuries , with the romans , crusaders , ottomans and the british empire among the factions fighting historical battles for control over the city . jerusalem contains numerous sacred sites claimed by christians , jews , and muslims , and is where jesus christ preached , died , and was later resurrected . british rule over the area ended in 1948 , which led to jordan ' s invasion and occupation of the old city , before israel captured the land in the 1967 middle east war . in 1980 israel declared jerusalem to be a " complete and united " city and capital of its country , to the protest of arab countries in the region . palestinians , on the other hand , see east jerusalem as their capital . they live in the city as israeli residents , receive access to services and vote in municipal elections . some become israeli citizens and can vote in parliamentary elections , but most refuse to do so .

" i turned down kevin sorbo for east coast comicon . he ' s pals with sean hannity . i just can ' t do it , " the promoter wrote . however , in an interview with lifezette on wednesday sorbo set the record straight . " i thought this [ the facebook post ] was pretty funny . i laughed , " the " andromeda " star said about the topic . sorbo said being discriminated on because of his conservative or political beliefs by a fan convention " is a first " for him . " to me , it ' s like , what a smart move . i was never even invited [ to the convention ] . my agent never went there . i went online and it ' s a very small con [ event ] , so he [ gailbraith ] was trying to drum up interest in his con and himself . i appreciate it and i applaud his entrepreneurial spirit , especially for a guy who is a socialist , " the 59 - year - old actor continued . the actor maintained that he was not at all surprised to see a " liberal person " judge him based solely on his conservative views . " the left is so angry about the election still , over a year later , " sorbo concluded . many of galbraith ' s liberal supporters on facebook praised him for making the decision to exclude sorbo , and one user even went as far as noting that sorbo had been listed on imdb ' s list of " racist or right - wing stars to avoid .

" " does the president have a sin problem " msnbc " live " anchor alex witt asked , referring to the porn star , stormy daniels . " he is not president perfect , " graham , the president and ceo of the billy graham evangelistic association , told witt . " president trump i don ' t think has admitted to having an affair with this person . and so this is just a news story , and i don ' t even know if it ' s accurate . " graham added that he believes " at 70 years of age , the president is a much different person today than he was four years ago , five years ago , 10 years ago , or whatever and we just have to give the man the benefit of the doubt . " trump said he didn ' t do it , " so okay , let ' s say he didn ' t do it , " graham added . asked about his support for a president who was recently accused of referring to haiti , el salvador and african nations as " s * * * hole countries , " graham said he doesn ' t think it ' s hypocritical . " he said he didn ' t say it , so i have to go along with the president in that he didn ' t say it , " graham added . " why are we having all these people from s - - - hole countries come here " trump allegedly asked during a recent meeting at the oval office in the white house with several republicans and democrats during immigration negotiations , according to the washington post , which also reported that the president said he would prefer people from countries like norway to come to america instead . " god has forgiven me and i ' ve asked for his forgiveness , and i think the president has , too , " graham said . " we certainly don ' t hold him up as the pastor of this nation and he is not . but i appreciate the fact that the president does have a concern for christian values , he does have a concern to protect christians whether its here at home or around the world and i appreciate the fact that he protects religious liberty and freedom . " the islamic state terror group , also known as is , isis , isil or daesh , recently lost its territorial empire in iraq and syria due to a u . s . - led military campaign . graham stressed that trump is " a businessman who is a president , not a politician , but a businessman . " he continued , " we should all be grateful that he ' s brought his knowledge to washington and he ' s helping to turn this economy around . " the president ' s deregulation and tax cut policies have resulted in the stock markets hitting record highs with the dow jones industrial average jumping past 25 , 000 for the first time ever earlier this month , among other economic indicators . earlier this month , the wall street journal reported that a lawyer for trump had paid 130 , 000 in hush money to stormy daniels . daniels , whose given name is stephanie clifford , has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with trump around the time that his wife melania had given birth to their son barron . according to the story , daniels and trump began their affair in july 2006 at american century celebrity golf tournament in which trump invited the porn star into his room and they had what she later described as " textbook generic " sex .
( photo : rocket republic , courtesy of erlc ) russell moore addresses evangelicals for life conference at the jw marriott hotel on january 18 , 2018 . washiNgtoN building a culture that values life will be a " 100 - year project " that requires christians to address our " protection of self " society , said prominent evangelical russell moore . and promoting that culture of life means equally valuing the unborn as well as the elderly , immigrants and refugees , the poor , the vulnerable , and women , he stressed while speaking at evangelicals for life 2018 . before hundreds assembled thursday at the j . w . marriott hotel in downtown washington , several speakers stressed the importance for christians to articulate a value for life at every stage . particular emphasis was given to the unborn as conference attendees participated in the march for life friday , the largest annual pro - life gathering in the nation . the conference was sponsored by focus on the family and the ethics religious liberty commission , the policy arm of the southern baptist convention . " the overturning of roe v . wade is necessary for justice but the overturning of roe v . wade does not by itself constitute justice , " said moore , president of the erlc in an interview with the christian post . overturning the contentious 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide would simply send the matter back to the states and culture , he pointed out . " but we also have to be working at dealing with the root of the problem as well . it ' s a both / and not an either / or , " he said , mentioning a feminist leader and abortion rights advocate whose words haunt him ; this feminist leader once said that " most americans are pro - life with three exceptions : rape , incest , and my situation . " " when one looks around and sees the culture in american life of the self and of protection of self it inevitably leads to an abortion culture . we have to address that as well , " moore said , adding that " this is not a four - or five - year project . this is going to have to be a 100 - year project . " moore , who during the 2016 election was a vocal critic of then candidate donald trump , has since praised the president ' s moves toward protecting the unborn while urging the administration to take a different approach toward immigrants and refugees . " i think there ' s a sense in which sometimes it is difficult to say political allies on one issue does not mean that a person is adopting completely everything that the movement articulates , " moore said when asked about trump ' s favorable moves toward protecting the unborn but unfavorable rhetoric and posture toward refugees and immigrants . " politics is important but politics is not ultimate , and so we are not afraid of it but we don ' t idolize it either that everything is not utopia or dystopia at any given moment . " in his remarks at the conference , the erlc president noted that a culture that values life cannot simultaneously value hedonism and pornography . the pro - life witness will never flourish where women are not valued , he said . " there was a time when churches were reluctant to talk about healthy sexuality but that has changed but not in ways that are altogether good , " moore told cp . " i will often see song of solomon preached sort of as a how - to guide to better sex rather than getting at the deeper fabric of what human sexuality is . i also think we have to have moral credibility on issues of sexuality . if god has revealed something to us about sexuality , and he has , we have to speak consistently both about sin and about the offer of grace . " churches cannot do this while ignoring the ravages of the divorce culture and refusing to speak to the issues of abuse , he continued to explain , a topic that has been accentuated as credible allegations of sexual misconduct by top leaders in many industries have surfaced in recent months . moore further recalled that he was once debating abortion with a pro - choice advocate who said , " well , if you all care about unborn children , why don ' t you adopt some children . " " and i said , ' i have so have many people that i know . ' and the response was almost immediately ' isn ' t it terrible that you religious people are adopting children and inculcating them into your worldview . ' " " the idea , as [ former congressman ] barney frank said years ago , ' pro - lifers begin at conception and ends at birth , ' is not true . and at the local level in many ways the pro - life movement has demonstrated that better than anyone , " moore said . the evangelicals for life conference also showcased the continuing growth and work of pro - life crisis pregnancy centers . " when i look at the sorts of ministries , too numerous to even count , that are helping vulnerable women , i can think of countless ministries that deal with the full range of the human experience where they ' re not simply talking about abortion decision itself , but getting at the root of what ' s going on in that woman ' s life and loving her , " moore said .

" in an official statement released last friday , president trump explained in the proclamation that the observance is meant to " affirm the truth that all life is sacred , that every person has inherent dignity and worth , and that no class of people should ever be discarded as ' non - human . ' " " reverence for every human life , one of the values for which our founding fathers fought , defines the character of our nation . today , it moves us to promote the health of pregnant mothers and their unborn children , " read the proclamation . " it animates our concern for single moms ; the elderly , the infirm , and the disabled ; and orphan and foster children . it compels us to address the opioid epidemic and to bring aid to those who struggle with mental illness . it gives us the courage to stand up for the weak and the powerless . " the proclamation also noted that scientific research " continues to support and build the case for " the pro - life movement and their agenda items . " medical technologies allow us to see images of the unborn children moving their newly formed fingers and toes , yawning , and even smiling , " continued the proclamation . " those images present us with irrefutable evidence that babies are growing within their mothers ' wombs precious , unique lives , each deserving a future filled with promise and hope . we can also now operate on babies in utero to stave off life - threatening diseases . " expand collapse ( photo : reuters / eric thayer ) particpants watch as u . s . president donald trump speaks by satellite from the nearby white house to attendees of the march for life anti - abortion rally in washington , u . s . january 19 , 2018 . trump ' s proclamation comes as the commander - in - chief became the first sitting president to address the annual march for life in washington , d . c . speaking via satellite from the white house rose garden , trump stated on friday that he was " honored " and " proud " to be the first commander - in - chief to address the march for life . " today , tens of thousands of families , students , and patriots , and really just great citizens , gather here in our nation ' s capital , " said trump , his speech broadcast on a large screen before the march for life rally attendees at the national mall . " you come from many backgrounds , many places , but you all come for one beautiful cause : to build a society where life is celebrated , protected , and cherished . the march for life is a movement born out of love . you love your families , you love your neighbors , you love our nation , and you love every child , born and unborn , because you believe that every life is sacred , that every child is a precious gift from god . " trump is not the first president to issue such a proclamation . for example , as one of his final actions as president , george w . bush declared jan . 18 , 2009 " national sanctity of human life day . " " the most basic duty of government is to protect the life of the innocent , " read bush ' s proclamation , as quoted by politico in 2009 . " my administration has been committed to building a culture of life by vigorously promoting adoption and parental notification laws , opposing federal funding for abortions overseas , encouraging teen abstinence and funding crisis pregnancy programs .

( photo : reuters / hannah mckay ) a priest wears a rainbow ribbon during a vigil against anglican homophobia , outside the general synod of the church of england in london , britain , february 15 , 2017 . the church of england ' s house of bishops has decided against creating a new service to celebrate a person ' s gender transition . the bishops are advising that the church mark the transgender occasion instead with the existing baptism rite . the archbishop of york , john sentamu , was one of the senior church officials who had called for a new baptism - style service specifically created for transgender christians . but in a private meeting at lambeth palace the bishops rejected the move , the mail reported on sunday . the rev . chris newlands said that it would be a " wonderful opportunity to create a liturgy which speaks powerfully to the particularities of trans people , and make a significant contribution to their well - being and support . " though the church will not be creating a new rite to mark a person ' s gender transition , clergy are being advised to use the existing rite , affirmation of baptismal faith , which was designed to celebrate the baptism or confirmation of a person . " the church of england welcomes transgender people and wholeheartedly wishes for them to be included in the life of the church , " the rt . rev . graham james , bishop of norwich , said in a statement . " on the matter of whether a new service is needed , the house of bishops has decided that the current service that is used to affirm baptism can be adapted . " clergy always have the discretion to compose and say prayers with people as they see fit . " the general synod officially passed a motion last july that welcomed and affirmed transgender people to the church , with the vote going overwhelmingly in favor of the change . the house of bishops was left to decide on whether special liturgical materials would be prepared to mark a person ' s gender transition in a baptism - style ceremony . cofe bishops are reportedly also working on a major " teaching document , " which will not be ready before 2020 , on the long - standing debate over same - sex marriage . the church defines marriage as a union solely between one man and one woman , though it has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative wings . conservative anglicans , such as the global anglican future conference , have accused church leadership of giving in to pressure to " compromise clear christian teaching in the face of secular humanist philosophy . " the church of england also raised eyebrows in november with its " valuing all god ' s children " report , which said that allowing children to cross - dress could be one way to tackle homophobia and transphobia at school . the report stated that lgbt children are often bullied , and so pupils should be allowed to play " with many cloaks of identity " when growing up without " judgment or derision , " such as boys wearing tutus , tiaras , and heels . " all bullying , including homophobic , biphobic and transphobic bullying causes profound damage , leading to higher levels of mental health disorders , self - harm , depression and suicide , " archbishop of canterbury justin welby said .
subscribe to canada free press for free the only way to end the conflict is to end the lies the big palestine lie palestinian boss mahmoud abbas recently declared that israel is a colonial enterprise that has nothing to do with jewishness . moses , king david and thousands of years of jewish history would disagree . israel and the jews are part of the story of human civilization . over 50 of the human race has a holy book that tells of the jewish journey to israel . that includes mohammed s own copy of the koran . israel isn t a colonial enterprise . palestine is . anyone who wants to find out where the name israel comes from can open the book of genesis 32 : 29 . the story even appears in islamic hadiths . but where does palestine really come from palestine isn t a hebrew or arabic word palestine isn t a hebrew or arabic word . the greeks used it to describe the area . and when the romans and their arab mercenaries repressed the indigenous jewish population , they renamed it all palestine . palestine , after the philistines : but why did the greeks and romans name the area after the philistines the philistines were one of the greek origin sea peoples who had originally invaded and colonized the area . the jewish resistance to philistine colonialism is chronicled in the histories of samson , king saul and king david . it was natural for the greek and roman colonies that the jews of the second temple era clashed with to use palestine , the name associated with earlier colonies , to refer to their new colonies . that latest phase of greek colonialism led to an extended conflict between the persian empire and greco - roman civilization . the romans made extended use of arab mercenaries and rulers to secure their dominions . one such ruler was herod , the son of an idumean father and a nabatean arab mother , ( according to the greek historian strabo they were both arabic peoples ) , who repressed the jews . the eventual decline and fall of the roman and persian empires made way for the islamic conquests of the region . but the islamic bandit hordes had no original ideas . their religion was a hodgepodge of judaism , christianity , assorted pagan beliefs and mohammed s violent fantasies . the rest of their culture they took wholesale from the greeks . this game of historical idiocracy ended with a collection of arab colonists who call themselves palestinians and claim to be descended from somebody . in germany , abbas declared that , the nation of palestine , throughout its long history , has been a beacon of generosity , and our people are an extension of the 3 , 500 - year - old canaanite civilization . the palestinian authority that the unelected dictator runs was created in 1993 . there was never any such independent country before that . and inquiring minds would love to know what an islamic terrorist group and the arab clans it oversees have in common with the canaanite civilization . fire , the wheel abbas also insisted that , mohammed the prophet was a palestinian but then , abbas also insisted that , mohammed the prophet was a palestinian . according to islamic tradition , mohammed was an adnanite arab from arabia . they claim descent from ishmael and abraham . that means they aren t canaanites . and a number of the arab clans who make up the palestinians do have their origins in arabia . for a brief , shining moment , abbas was telling the truth . previously , abbas had also claimed that jesus was a palestinian . if you re keeping track , that means the palestinians are canaanites , arabs and jews . that certainly covers a lot of historical bases . but we re just getting started . the bible says , in these words , that the palestinians existed before abraham , abbas also insisted . the bible doesn t say anything in these words , but people took it to mean that he was claiming that the palestinians were actually the philistines . but then he took credit for the invention of the canaanite - palestinian alphabet more than 6 , 000 years ago . there s no such alphabet . the palestinian authority and muslims in israel use the arabic alphabet which does have its extremely distant origins in the phoenician proto - canaanite alphabet . but so does greek , latin and the letters you re reading now . like most of the palestinian leader s claims , it s nonsense . within a few years , abbas claimed that the palestinians are descended from the canaanites , the philistines , the jews and the arabs . only the last one is true . the palestinians were part of a wave of arab and islamic invaders whose incursions continued well into the modern era . there are some 10 , 000 afro - palestinians in gaza . some are african settlers who came in the 19 th century . the anti - israel left would have you believe that a sudanese muslim who settled in israel in the late 19 th century is an indigenous palestinian , but a jewish refugee from egypt is a foreign settler . continued below . . . the palestinians are what they always were : a foreign islamic arab colony inside israel the arab muslims who live in 48 and 67 israel are made up of various clans from around the region . abbas has referred to jordan and palestine as one people living in two states . hamas interior minister fathi hammad had once asserted , personally , half my family is egyptian . we are all like that . more than 30 families in the gaza strip are called al - masri ( egyptian ) . brothers , half of the palestinians are egyptians and the other half are saudis . the most famous al - masri is a billionaire who lives in a west bank reproduction of an italian villa named the house of palestine , and was recently detained by the saudis . munib masri served as a palestinian authority minister , holds a legislative seat and accounts for a quarter of the palestinian economy . the greenhouse in his villa was a gift from napoleon iii to his mistress . masri , whose family name originated in egypt , and claims to be a palestinian , is actually a saudi citizen who lives in an imported italian villa . he made his money supplying the Us military during desert storm . that s what a palestinian looks like . the palestinians are egyptians , saudis , jordanians , senegalese , sudanese and a number of other muslim invasive colonists . they are not philistines , canaanites or jews . they re as indigenous as al - masri s house of palestine made out of imported italian marble and filled with european art . the palestinians are what they always were : a foreign islamic arab colony inside israel . continued below . . . news from idealmedia . com the palestinians are not the victims of colonialism . they are its perpetrators the big lie of palestine is that the islamic colonists are the indigenous population of israel and that the jews are colonizing palestine . but an indigenous people can never colonize their own country . palestine is a twisted colonial fiction . the name reflects greek colonization of the region . and its use by the modern islamic colonists shows their lack of any actual historical connection to israel . after all the agonized wailing about the deeply meaningful palestinian connection to palestine , they still haven t come up with their own name for the place . one that they can properly pronounce . ( there s no proper p in arabic . ) but abbas keeps coming up with new lies about which ancient people the palestinians are descended from this week . i can t wait until he claims to be cherokee . the claim of the palestinian colonists to israel is a lie of islamic imperialism . the muslim powers of the region have funded the racist attacks by the plo , hamas and other islamic terrorist groups on jews . the palestinians are not the victims of colonialism . they are its perpetrators . the fighting between israel and islamic terrorists is a struggle between imperialism and colonialism . the imperialists are not the oppressed jewish minority that has been forced out of nearly everywhere else in the region . it s the arab islamic majority that represses minorities across the region . palestine is a pathetic attempt to launder one imperial identity with another followed by shameless efforts to appropriate the identities of nearly every ancient people in the region . including the jews . the only way to end the conflict is to end the lies .
daniel greenfield daniel greenfield is a new york city writer and columnist . he is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center and his articles appears at its front page magazine site . most recent articles by daniel greenfield : jan 24 , 2018 daniel greenfield palestinian boss mahmoud abbas recently declared that israel is a colonial enterprise that has nothing to do with jewishness . moses , king david and thousands of years of jewish history would disagree . israel and the jews are part of the story of human civilization . over 50 of the human race has a holy book that tells of the jewish journey to israel . that includes mohammed s own copy of the koran . israel isn t a colonial enterprise . palestine is . anyone who wants to find out where the name israel comes from can open the book of genesis 32 : 29 . the story even appears in islamic hadiths . but where does palestine really come from jan 21 , 2018 daniel greenfield there are two statistics that explain the democrat obsession with illegal immigration and open borders . 97 of immigrants in the appropriate grouping identify themselves as hispanic , but by the fourth generation that number falls to half . only 7 of immigrants describe themselves as americans , but 56 in the third generation call themselves americans . even the use of spanish is slowly declining . if a minority stops existing after a few generations , did it ever actually exist jan 19 , 2018 daniel greenfield last winter , the local media was touting imam abdullah khadra as a victim of president trump s travel ban . khadra , a syrian , was here on a religious worker visa and was applying for political asylum . the refugee imam living in north carolina called trump s move , absolutely inhumane and ridiculous . jewish leftists agreed . lucy dinner , the clergywoman from temple beth or in raleigh , denounced singling out an entire group of people based on their faith . lucy dinner had previously signed a letter in support of anti - israel activism by eric and jennifer solomon . eric solomon was affiliated with the anti - israel hate group , t ruah , and jenny solomon ran controversial educational programs at the nc hillel . jan 18 , 2018 daniel greenfield president trump s end year remarks to the new york times acerbically summed up his relationship with the media . i m going to win another four years because newspapers , television , all forms of media will tank if i m not there . the answering outburst of rage and contempt from the media burned all the hotter because the statement was not only intentionally provocative ; it was also true . the media has never been able to quit trump . its conviction that it can destroy him through coverage has repeatedly proven false . but that hasn t stopped the media from throwing more coverage at him . and its motive for the non - stop coverage has always been the selfish pursuit of ratings , clicks and sales . jan 14 , 2018 daniel greenfield ( i wrote this article quite a few years ago . i feel that it s relevant now in light of the oprah for president movement . ) obama s political success was built on his ability to invoke values detached from belief systems . to break away symbols and ideals from religious and national value systems , and mix and match them into his own sound bites . like the famous hope poster , that mixed patriotic color schemes with socialist realism , or his own speeches which invoked the founders in support of socialism . the obama wave was piggybacking on a culture where context had ceased to matter . obama s image had more in common with the way hip hop artists sample songs , than with a symphony . his campaign was the perfect trailer to a movie that would never be released . it was the marriage of corporate advertising campaigns , pop culture , radical politics and americana thrown together in a pot and boiled into one indecipherable mix that was appealing , and yet completely void of meaning . jan 13 , 2018 daniel greenfield we re in the middle of a civil war . it may not be a shooting war . for the most part . ( though don t tell that to some republicans at a charity game practice who were targeted by a bernie sanders supporter . ) but it s a war all the same . the war is still being fought with paper and protests . but it s based on irreconcilable differences between parts of the country . much like the ones that brought on the war between brothers . jan 12 , 2018 daniel greenfield prime minister thatcher once famously observed that socialists always run out of other people s money . but what actually happens when socialism runs out of money venezuela , a once wealthy nation with black gold coming out of the ground , is a test case . the socialist regime ran out of other people s money , and then out of money , years ago . the government met protests by its starving population with a 40 minimum wage hike . that s the usual socialist solution to what leftists call income inequality . the problem is that 40 of nothing is still zero . jan 10 , 2018 daniel greenfield in october , 125 psychologists and assorted mental health professionals marched to new york s city hall while wearing red tags warning , danger . leading the march was peter fraenkel , author of sync your relationship , save your marriage , mournfully beating a drum in a solemn march . fraenkel , a psychologist and professional drummer was able to combine his love of drums and hatred of trump . the duty to warn march had begun at new york law school where the experts demanded that trump be removed from office based on their inability to understand the 25 th amendment . and then the mental health experts marched to the beat of fraenkel s drum in what they insisted was a funereal and dignified procession . please wear professional attire or dark clothing , the mental health experts were instructed . there will be a slow drum beat , danger tape , and flashing warning lights . jan 8 , 2018 daniel greenfield we pay the palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect , president trump tweeted . with the palestinians no longer willing to talk peace , why should we make any of these massive future payments to them the president of the united states has a very good point . but it s not as if the islamic terrorists in the west bank and gazan territories of israel have ever been willing to do more than occasionally talk peace before getting bored and stomping away from the table . and then stabbing a few children to death . the united states has paid the plo s palestinian authority billions to occasionally pretend to talk about peace . there isn t a dollar amount high enough to get the terrorists to actually agree to peace . jan 3 , 2018 daniel greenfield the original civil war was fought by farmhands and factory workers , freed slaves and young boys turned soldiers ; the new civil war is being fought by lawyers in blue or gray suits not with bullets , but with bullet points . from the mueller investigation to federal judges declaring that president trump doesn t have the right to control immigration policy or command the military , from political sabotage at the doj by obama appointees like sally yates to patagonia s lawsuit over national monuments , the cold civil war set off by the left s rejection of the 2016 election results has been a paper war largely waged by lawyers . the biggest threat to new yorkers right now is the federal government , attorney general eric schneiderman of new york recently declared . the radical leftist pol who had once vowed to do everything possible to elect hillary clinton was explaining his hundred lawsuits against the government on everything from net neutrality to the travel ban meant to keep out the islamic terrorists running over tourists near ground zero and bombing commuters in the tunnels off times square . jan 2 , 2018 daniel greenfield prime minister margaret thatcher famously observed that socialism works until you run out of other people s money . identity politics also works until you run out of other people . and then metoo becomes notmetoo . other people s money can be borrowed against . that s why we have the national debt that we do . but identity politics has multiplied too abruptly and explosively to postpone the reckoning much longer . what were once simple categories of three races and two genders has mutated into an infinite alphabet of sexual identities , a big bang of ethnicities , national , cultural , racial and religious , each with its own microaggressions , that easily tops two hundred and shows no signs of slowing down its expansion . dec 30 , 2017 daniel greenfield saleh ali was one of 64 , 000 syrian refugees living in the netherlands . the vast majority , like ali , are young men . and the largest number of these migrants spend their days idling in amsterdam . on thursday morning , saleh ali took a walk to trendy amstelveenseweg while wearing a keffiyah and waving a terrorist plo flag . he stopped in front of a jewish restaurant , shouted allahu akbar and began smashing the windows . the amsterdam police stood by and watched quizzically until he was done . then when he entered the restaurant , they finally called him out and arrested him . and in two days he was back on the street . dec 27 , 2017 daniel greenfield you might think that the biggest threat to new yorkers is the string of islamic terrorist attacks , including the recent times square suicide bombing and the ground zero adjacent car jihad . but new york s left - wing ag , who once vowed to give anti - semitic lynch mob leader al sharpton a place in his office , knows better . schneiderman remains undeterred in what he views as a significant role in protecting new yorkers from washington . we try and protect new yorkers from those who would do them harm , he told the times . the biggest threat to new yorkers right now is the federal government , so we re responding to it . i love how in a brief matter of months , secessionist rhetoric has become so mainstreamed among dems . the bosses of california and new york suddenly sound like militia leaders in idaho . more dec 25 , 2017 daniel greenfield foremost , the nasa administrator described his marching orders from obama , he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the muslim world . the great new mission of america s space agency would be to make muslims feel good about their historic contribution to science . president trump has another mission for nasa . looking over at former senator schmitt , the last living man to walk on the moon in the apollo 17 mission forty - five years ago , president trump said , today , we pledge that he will not be the last . dec 21 , 2017 daniel greenfield akayed ullah , a bangladeshi muslim living in brooklyn , really hated christmas . he hated christmas so much that he used christmas tree lights ( along with a battery and some wire ) as a trigger for a pipe bomb . he filled the pipe bomb with screws so that when it went off , metal shrapnel would tear bloody holes through morning commuters in manhattan . wearing a hooded jacket and a backpack to cover the pipe bomb strapped to his body , ullah got on the f train at the 18 th avenue elevated subway station off little bangladesh . like the duke ellington song says , he switched over to the a train at jay street . it was early morning , but there were plenty of people riding the train . jay street is a major transit hub . but ullah was waiting to blow up somewhere else . he got off in the crush at the 42 nd - st . port authority station . here a whole lot of people can be found rushing up and down crowded staircases and shoving their way through cramped corridors . dec 14 , 2017 daniel greenfield amsterdam s hacarmel restaurant sits between two other restaurants . the jewish kosher eatery whose big blue sign boasts fish , meat and vegetarian options is sandwiched between a sidewalk caf with its inevitable heineken umbrellas on one corner of amstelveenseweg and an ice cream place on the other corner . there s an italian restaurant across the street with some very nice front windows . if the muslim refugee had wanted to smash up any eatery , he had plenty of options . but he went to the kosher restaurant . inside were wooden chairs , white tablecloths and red roses . outside came the guttural shriek of , allahu akbar . this was the battle cry with which mohammed had inaugurated his massacre and enslavement of the jews . the cuisine inside hacarmel is middle eastern , but the attack showed why there are few jews ( or christians ) left in the middle east outside israel . the amsterdam cops had plenty of warning . the palestinian was wearing a keffiyah on his head , waving a large plo flag in one hand and brandishing a club in the other while shouting , allahu akbar . dec 12 , 2017 daniel greenfield hamas has announced that president trump s recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel has opened the gates of hell . its muslim brotherhood parent has declared america an enemy state . the arab league boss warned that the jerusalem move will fuel extremism and result in violence . the jordanian foreign minister claimed that it

this month . the heads of the men who actually make the news are rolling left and right . dec 6 , 2017 daniel greenfield huma abedin did not know that clinton had a private server until about a year and a half ago when it became public knowledge . abedin , hillary s closest aide , was being interviewed at the fbi s washington d . c . field office by two unnamed agents . also present was peter strzok , the counterintelligence fbi figure embroiled in a scandal because of the pro - hillary and anti - trump texts exposed by his extramarital affair . the field office is another one of those bland government buildings located near enough to the mall for tourists who are going the wrong way to stumble on it , but not interesting enough for them to notice it . the building , like so many others , is part of the deeper architecture of the governing city that matters far more than the showy museums or even the white house and its adjacent eisenhower executive office building . the decisions that make the news happen in the white house and the eisenhower executive office building . but the decisions that really matter take place in more obscure places , like a bland government

series of trump associates are forced to plead guilty to lying to the fbi . while hillary continues her spite across america tour . did close hillary associates like cheryl mills , hillary s right - hand woman , and huma abedin lie to the fbi as evidence assembled by chuck ross at the daily caller suggests , it rather looks like it . more

the battle against human trafficking and exploitation has been an ongoing global blight throughout history . today it is estimated that this multi - billion dollar industry is responsible for the enslavement and exploitation of approximately 20 . 9 million people around the world . despite the fact that this is a massive problem , affecting both men and women young and old , many of us are still unaware of the depth of the problem that we are facing in today s society . the term human trafficking is often associated solely with sex slavery , however , that is only one of a number of situations that would fall under this umbrella . the department of homeland security explains that human trafficking is modern - day slavery and involves the use of force , fraud , or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act . by this definition , human trafficking would include a young woman forced into prostitution , a child forced into unpaid labor or a man working at a commercial farming operation after his employer stripped him of his passport , leaving him with no other recourse . in recent history , world leaders have reaffirmed their dedication to cracking down on traffickers . government leaders in the united kingdom have developed plans to crackdown on the high rate of human trafficking in nigeria , committing nearly 9 . 5 million usd to eradicate the problem at the root . meanwhile , egyptian law enforcement started 2018 with the detention of 75 people following a 14 - month investigation by the administrative control authority . the arrests included government officials , egyptian citizens and foreigners . the egyptian raids raise an important point in the consideration of human trafficking cases those involved are not always low - level criminals . in fact , many of those that have been arrested in association with these crimes are high - profile , professional individuals , government officials and business owners . there have been rumors that additional high - level arrests have been made , and media sources in the united states are even being given access to the information at this time in preparation for the story going public , however , u . s . officials are keeping quiet at this time so as to avoid the release of information that could harm their efforts or hinder the capture of those responsible . within the united states , individual state officials have been making advances in their efforts to crack down on this heinous crime . recently state lawmakers in wisconsin have expanded upon their existing laws following 82 arrests as part of a nationwide sting . the new proposed laws would expand upon the ability to subpoena internet providers for records by also allowing hotel internet records to be collected including the customer s name , address , phone number and the duration of their stay . matt joy , director of the human trafficking bureau and internet crimes against children task force with the wisconsin department of justice explains , we started recognizing , as we built our human trafficking capacities over the last year , that this tool could be a great benefit to those who are engaged in human trafficking investigations . january 2018 has officially been declared as national slavery and human trafficking prevention month by president donald trump . the official statement on the white house website states : during national slavery and human trafficking prevention month , we recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement . human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most barbaric type of exploitation . it has no place in our world . this month we do not simply reflect on this appalling reality . we also pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent victims around the world . image via odyssey
spanning 3 . 6 million square miles , the sahara desert is the largest hot desert in the entire world . a vast expanse of desert mountains , high plateaus , and barren desert sands , it is no shock that the area boasts a hot , dry climate throughout the year . in fact , experts report that half of the sahara desert receives less than an inch of rain over the course of the year , while the other half isn t much better , receiving up to 4 inches . you can imagine everyone s shock when the sand dunes of that very desert were dusted with snow . the town of ain sefra in algeria saw 1 - 2 inches of snow in the early hours of sunday morning with the outskirts surrounding the city seeing up to 16 inches in some areas incredibly , this isn t the first time in the recent past that this has occurred . the town saw snow following christmas 2016 , sending the city into complete chaos and disarray . prior to the 2016 storm , the area hadn t seen snow since february 18 , 1979 . it seems like the snowy pictures were taken across the higher areas in the north of the region , towards the atlas regions , so it s not surprising that the area would see some snow if the conditions were right , said a spokeswoman for the met office . with the setup over europe at the moment , which has given us cold weather over the weekend , a push southwards of cold air into that region and some sort of moisture would bring that snow . when asked about the phenomenon , photographer karim bouchetata stated , we were really surprised when we woke up to see snow again . it stayed all day on sunday and began melting at around 5 pm . while children made snowmen and snow angels and took their makeshift sleds to ride down the dunes , bouchetata , along with numerous other photographers , took out their cameras to capture the rare beauty . check out these stunning photos , straight from the sahara desert :

question : is president donald trump slamming the door on muslims so - called american dream ( making america sharia - compliant ) contrary to what they say in this video , it is NOt islamophobia , xenophobia , or racism . it is an informed and justifiable hatred of islam and a very rational fear of muslims that is making muslims feel unwanted in america . since us president donald trump came to power , muslim americans say they feel increasingly unwelcome in their own country . according to critics , trump s executive orders banning travellers from several muslim - majority countries and his anti - muslim rhetoric have normalized what ignorant people like to call islamophobia . according to pew research , among others , there is great hatred towards americans by large segments of the muslim population . most recently , a poll from the center for security policy released data showing 25 of those polled agreed that violence against americans here in the united states is justified as a part of the global jihad and 51 of those polled , agreed that muslims in america should have the choice of being governed according to sharia . sharia authorizes such atrocities as murder against non - believers who won t convert , beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to americans , especially women . mr . trump stated , without looking at the various polling data , it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension . where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine . until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses , our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad , and have no sense of reason or respect for human life .
the romantics within us want to believe that every marriage can be saved . but this just is not reality . if one of the partners cheats or is abusive , then the other person has every right to leave that relationship . people need to feel like they can trust their partner , and if that is violated , it is not the victim s fault if they want to move forward with their life . while we do not know what caused lori s divorce , it was still a massive change in her life . she stopped taking care of herself and felt like she didn t know who she was anymore . her identity had been tied up with her marriage , and after it failed , she needed to discover who she was again . after months of wallowing , she was ready to make a fresh start . and as many people will , she decided to change the way she looked . with a fresh makeover , she hoped that she d get a second chance at life and be able to start again . eager for a new look , lori reached out to christopher hopkins . he was the perfect man for the job . dubbed the makeover guy , christopher owns a beauty salon in minneapolis and shares his transformational work on youtube under the popular channel that has more than 30 , 000 subscribers and counting . although every makeover christopher completes holds a special place in his heart , lori s was particularly special . she and he graduated from high school around the same time as each other and grew up in the same neighborhood . it was his way to give back to his community and help lori on her path to rediscovering the woman she wanted to be . i have to admit i had extra fun with lori because we graduated about the same year from nearby high schools in southwestern minnesota . i think this may be one of my favorites . amy zwievelhofer took lori s hair from blah brown to beautiful auburn , meticulous makeup by amy goulet or kami klevin i m not sure . and i did the cut which needed more length still . she said she d come back in 6 months , but i ve yet to see her hello lori the video caption reads . stylists like christopher are often confronted with a lot of negativity . their clients do not think they can be transformed . they come into the salon with a lack of trust and appreciation for christopher as an artist . but as he proceeds to prove with lori , and all the other makeovers on his youtube channel , he is a master of making people look their best . lori allows christopher to do everything he wants . she doesn t try to hold back his creativity . in the end , lori looks like a new woman . she is smiling . she looks bright . her hair looks much better . and she feels like she is ready to take a fresh start . watching the change is inspiring , especially since many people believe that they cannot change . check out the video below to see christopher give lori the gift of a second change . it is inspiring .
it s one thing to be kind to those who you know , but it s quite another to shower a complete stranger with kindness . when 18 - year - old luis xavier del rosario got off a bus in sydney , australia , he was greeted by an unbelievable heat . not far from the bus stop he saw a homeless man begging by the queen victoria building . it didn t take long for rosario to feel bad for him , especially considering the pavement he was standing on was scorching . i felt really bad for him , said rosario , who was impressed by the man s sign that had words of positivity . i saw his cardboard sign and his motto of smiling and staying positive , it really touched me . it all started when rosario bought the man some water and sat down with him . rosario , who is a south australian student , learned that the man s name was ian and he had been living on the streets for six years . he was instantly intrigued by him and inspired to help him so it was right then and there that he asked ian if he could help him change his life . he seemed skeptical at first but he quickly got up it s good that we were able to establish that level of trust , especially for complete strangers , said rosario . in those first few moments , rosario learned a lot about ian including the fact that the 52 - year - old man was afraid to die without being remembered . rosario started their journey together by getting ian a fresh shower , some new clothes , and a haircut at a barbershop so he could look presentable while hunting for a job . lacking proper education , ian had always struggled to find work that would help him survive . ian had grown up in a broken family and has been on his own since he was a child . he said he had been struggling for most of his life due to the lack of proper education , said rosario . he never mentioned what work he did before , but he told me he had no qualifications . for the first time in weeks , the man had eaten his first real meal thanks to rosario who took him out for pub chicken schnitzel .
nothing has the power to induce tears of joy as much as a military family reunion . because brave service men and women need to leave their families to fight for freedom and democracy around the world in the name of the united states of america , they inevitably leave behind loved ones . and these family members and friends must wait anxiously to hear from them via long - distant communication or their eventual homecoming . and although things are not as dangerous as they were a few years ago , service men and women are still at considerable risk . and sometimes they do not make it home safely . this is a tragedy . but a few days ago , a seven - year - old girl got the surprise of her life when her father came home from deployment and visited her at her school . during a school - wide assembly on tuesday at the okte elementary school in clifton park , new york , a little girl was suddenly pushed into the spotlight when little natalie plamondon s mother was invited to be a guest reader . and natalie stepped up to join her mother in reading hero dad to the assembly of students . my dad is an american soldier . my dad is my superhero , natalie read from the book aloud to her classmates . none of the children there knew that a huge surprise was awaiting natalie as soon as she finished the story . with the book finished , lt . col . jean - paul plamondon walked into the room and gave natalie the surprise of her life . as soon as she recognized her father , she darted across the room to jump into his arms . for nearly a year , plamondon has been in kuwait on deployment . although he has been able to communicate with them through video chat , he has not seen his daughter or his wife , valerie , in months . and because valerie knew her husband was soon returning , she worked with the school to make it a surprise for their daughter . i thought it was going to be january 31 st . i thought he was somebody else , but then when i realized it was daddy , i just wanted to run and hug him , natalie told a reporter with fox friends , ainsley earhardt . on the fox friends story , some people stated that they were offended how the homecoming came during school and interrupted class . robert racy quickly defended the military family s unique homecoming . an american kid welcoming home her dad , a u . s . soldier protecting our country so that she and her classmates can enjoy this great country in peace offends you you sound bitter and jealous , the reader says to the person who did not like how the homecoming disrupted the class . another person wrote how videos like this serve as reminders of the good work the people in the united states military do . they should post videos like this every single day to remind people that our protectors have families too . god bless them all . thank you for your service , and may god continue to bless you and yours , lt . col . jean - paul plamondon . watch the amazing homecoming below . what is your reaction to the clip
tokyo may be onto something with their new work for food policy . on a mission to combat hunger , mirai shokudo owner , ms . sekai kobayashi has implemented a new policy and it makes a whole lot of sense . if someone comes into her restaurant and can t afford a meal , she gives them an option to work for the food instead . if they choose the work , they will be assigned 50 minutes of restaurant chores including , serving dishes , clearing tables , and other tasks to keep the restaurant running . as the only employee at the restaurant , kobayashi welcomes the help in exchange for one of her dishes and so far , people are taking her up on her offer , as 500 guests have opted for the work for food exchange . several of those guests have been university students who appreciate the opportunity to save money . there are two ways to cash in on the work . you can either get a hot meal right on the spot after completing your work assignment or you can receive a free meal coupon that can be placed at the restaurant s entrance are for anyone to use . so essentially , so people are working for the sake of giving others a free meal . talk about a good way to pay it forward and battle the hunger epidemic . it all started two years ago when kobayashi opened the restaurant in the city s jinbocho district hoping to have a place where everyone was welcome and fits in . instead , we offer meals in return for 50 minutes of labor at the restaurant , said kobayashi . i use this system because i want to connect with hungry people who otherwise couldn t eat at restaurants because they don t have money . believe it or not , she has found her business to be profitable , and it does wonders for the community . through various methods , i ve also kept the business profitable , she said of her business , where the daily lunch special is priced at 900 yen ( 10 . 50 ) . evidently , kobayashi s education paid off . i dabbled in shop management as a university student . each year at the university s annual festival , i ran a dimly lit cafe stocked with books , said ms . kobayashi of her initial foray into the food and beverage ( f b ) trade . the cafe won first prize in the festival popularity contest in all four years when i was a student . i even opened cafes at other school festivals , she added . she has a broad background in jobs including her role working in restaurants and pubs in shinjuku s golden gai district in tokyo . after she graduated from school , a bar master who she worked with her gave her the advice of experiencing the outside world . after working for ibm japan as an engineer , she started working for a cooking recipe website called , cookpad . my colleagues really liked the lunches i made for them , said kobayashi , regarding the company s in - office kitchen . this led me to strongly consider opening my own restaurant . she admitted that her background has helped her get to where she is today , including her experience as an engineer . to manage my restaurant , i adopted an open - source model a system through which software design is made available for free to the public so that everyone can improve upon it . i posted the restaurant s business plan and finances on its website so i can collect input from the public on how to make improvements . this information is also available for those who want to open their own restaurants . sharing something with others means supporting those with ambition . that underpins my approach to work , she said .

( photo : facebook ) david allen turpin , 57 , and his wife louise anna turpin , 49 , are pictured here with their 13 children . homeschooling advocates are concerned about additional regulations after news of abuse from homeschooling parents in california . the massachusetts - based coalition for responsible home education , a nonprofit group that is actively advocating for homeschooling reform , says a lack of oversight for homeschools allows abuse , such at the recent case in perris , california , to go unchecked and is now calling for increased regulation of homeschools . pentecostal christian couple david allen turpin , 57 , and his 49 - year - old wife , louise anna turpin , were arrested on jan . 14 , after police had to rescue their 13 severely malnourished children from their home in perris , california . the home was registered as a homeschool . " the lack of oversight of home schools is what allows people to hide abuse , " kathryn brightbill , legislative policy analyst for the coalition told the press - enterprise . " we believe that the various states should introduce legislation to have annual contact with mandated reporters . " and a statement from the board of directors of the homeschool association of california said they anticipate new legislation is on the horizon . " we know that many homeschooling families are feeling nervous due to the recent abuse case which has been in the news , " the directors said . " we do suspect legislation may be forthcoming that might try to regulate private homeschoolers . we do not know what form that proposed legislation will take and it is a complicated endeavor that is likely to take some time . we assure you that hsc will have a hand in fighting or helping to define any bills that are proposed . " in an earlier statement , debbie schwarzer , the organization ' s legal team co - chair dismissed the idea of an annual inspection requirement for homeschooled children . " i ' ve seen articles that suggest that private homeschoolers should be required to present their children for an annual inspection by teachers and a doctor . it ' s an outrageous suggestion , one that amounts to suspecting all homeschooling parents of being unfit , of being capable of crimes against their children , " schwarzer wrote . " obviously the overwhelming majority of parents who choose to homeschool their children do so with the best interests of their children as their top priority . they should not be subjected to suspicion by the state and gross invasion of their privacy through unwarranted intrusion into their lives . the state and society should give them the same benefit of the doubt that all parents are given , of acting in their children ' s best interests until specific facts or circumstances suggest otherwise , " she added . data cited by the coalition for responsible home education argues there is very little accountability for homeschooling parents across the nation . some 11 states do not require parents to provide notice of homeschooling , 14 states do not require parents to provide instruction in any specific subject , 25 states do not require any form of academic assessments , parents in 39 states are not required to have a high school diploma , Ged , or other qualifications and 48 states have no protections for at - risk homeschooled children . " the current lack of accountability or oversight of homeschooling has negative consequences for thousands of homeschooled children . in some cases homeschooling serves to hide abuse , and in other cases parents shortchange their children educationally , " the organization said . according to the u . s . department of education , there were an estimated 1 . 8 million homeschooled students in the united states in 2012 . this number showed an increase from 850 , 000 in 1999 , when estimates were first reported . california law requires all children between 6 and 18 to be enrolled in public school unless their parents opt to make them attend a " full - time , private day school " or learn from a private tutor with a valid california teaching certificate , according to the press enterprise . anyone who homeschools at least six students , like the turpin family must file to form their own " private school . " the turpins registered their home as a private school named sandcastle day school whose only students were their children . authorities who rescued the christian couple ' s children said they had very little knowledge of the outside world and were poorly homeschooled . last thursday , david and louise turpin were charged with 12 criminal counts of torture , seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult , and 12 counts of false imprisonment that could keep them behind bars for life if they are convicted . david turpin also faces one count of committing a lewd act by force or fear . he and his wife have both pleaded not guilty and are now being held on bail of 13 million each .

the subject of gavin mcinnes being fired from the news outlet he created because of a piece he wrote was brought to my attention today through justine tunney s article in defense of gavin mcinnes . as a transwoman myself , i completely identify with tunney s words , however unpopular they may be . not because i m transgendered , but simply because she s right . she speaks of freedom of expression and press , and as a journalist it frightens me that we can be torn from our own publication , have our families targeted and threatened with financial ruin by a mob of hysterical speech - hating cretins , simply for the words we write . the public forums with integrated up / down - voting mechanisms for discussion , such as reddit , showed a rise in the idea that you could lessen the value of speech with the press of a button , not because it was wrong or because you rebutted with a superior counter - argument , rather because you just don t like what you re reading . it s this mentality that has seeped into the minds of most people using the internet , and it s truly a testament to a willing erosion of our rights to express ourselves . when it becomes not about discussion , dialogue and diversity of opinion , but instead about censoring what we don t agree with ( along with trying to destroy the other persons life ) , we have truly lost our way . i was featured in an article in VicE about a trolling organization i was a part of , known as the rustle league . in the article i openly support the westboro baptist church , not because i agree with them , but because they are one of the final bastions of freedom of speech in america and i will defend , to my death , their right to protest as many fags as they want . i also received threats because of that article . before that , i was included on an australian television show about internet trolling , where i was portrayed as the devil incarnate as a crowd of onlookers passed judgement before the show had even begun , not for what i said or had said , but because it could be said . the following week , i did an interview as a companion piece to the airing of the television show and the amount of vitriol spewed toward me in the comment section far exceeded anything i have ever said or done , but god bless them for saying it . it s unfortunate the website had to close the comments section down because of the influx of troll - hating trolls being trolled into trolling , it made for quality trolling . my tenure on the internet spans from the mid - nineties to present and the amount of hatred directed towards me in a week is more than some people get in a lifetime . does it bother me no . why because we all have a right to our opinions . what does bother me , however , is how quickly people will be there to try to take that right away and most of all , how successful they are . love it or leave it , just don t delete it .

creepy is how it feels to walk through the mall of america especially in the christmas season , where most of the women there are covered from head to toe in islamic supremacist slave attire . maybe the mall should be renamed mall of mogadishu since all you see are somali muslims . no wonder more and more people are shopping online . and it was just a little of over a year ago when a somali muslim terrorist stabbed 10 people at the crossroads mall in st . cloud , minnesota , before being shot dead by police . gangs of somali muslims have been terrorizing minneapolis communities , threatening to kidnap and rape female residents . no wonder the state has been nicknamed minnesotastan . and who could forget the somali muslim cop in minneapolis who shot and killed an unarmed australian woman for no reason at all this happened in july and the killer cop is still on administrative leave and has not yet been charged . smells like a cover - up .
zahr k . said didn t think much about her inability to check in online for her flight home to seattle after an october business trip in beijing . she also didn t worry too much about being twice singled out for additional screening before boarding her flight and again at the u . s . customs and border protection checkpoint at seattle international airport . the intercept the university of washington law professor assumed the heightened security measures might have been linked to an annual weeklong communist conference in china . but when she had similar difficulties checking in for an october 26 flight to irvine , california , said realized it was more than just an anomaly . she was puzzled that , despite having global entry clearance , which allowed her expedited entry through airport security and customs , she had become a target for airport questioning and invasive pat - downs . three days later , said got an email from cbp notifying her that her global entry clearance had been revoked . said spoke to the enrollment office at the seattle airport , which told her that the revocation came from a higher office responsible for vetting procedures , she said . i live in seattle . i have children . i have two stepchildren . i have a husband . i teach yoga . said , 41 , told the intercept . it all makes me who i am and i feel all of those things evaporate in a second when tsa or cbp seem to make it about me having a yemeni father or being born in lebanon . but said is not alone . she is one of hundreds of travelers with a muslim , arab , or south asian background whose global entry clearances were revoked , in what lawyers and civil rights activists say is a de facto extension of the trump administration s muslim travel ban . as reported by bloomberg , the us customs and border protection revoked without any explanation or warning the memberships of some global entry and other trusted traveler programs members , including neXus , secure electronic network and free and secure trade . according to the american - arab anti - discrimination committee and the dozens of complaints it received , american citizens whose memberships were revoked didn t know about it until they tried to travel . some people who claimed that their memberships in the global entry and other trusted traveler programs were revoked were us citizens originally from countries that were not included in the ban , such as india , lebanon and pakistan . a spokesman for the american - arab anti - discrimination committee said that he was fairly certain that people were removed from the program ( s ) based on their names . global entry is one of four cbp trusted traveler programs that allow vetted u . s . citizens , lawful permanent residents , and nationals from nine countries expedited entry through airport security and customs . in order to obtain global entry clearance , applicants must provide biometric records and undergo interviews and background checks . days after president donald trump signed a hotly contested executive order restricting immigration from seven muslim - majority countries , about 30 muslim and arab travelers in the united states reported to adc that cbp revoked their global entry clearances , according to immigration attorneys andrew free and greg siskind , who filed a lawsuit on adc s behalf . what has happened , in practice , is that muslims who were once able by the virtue of global entry to escape the constant racial and ethnic profiling they faced when traveling have now been suddenly , and without explanation , denied that privilege , free told the intercept . the only thing they all have in common is that nothing has changed in their own personal situations , and , of course , the reality of their own identities .
in dearborn , a notorious muslim - dominant area of michigan , arab muslim attorney , majed moughni ( right ) , has dropped two lawsuits against the little caesars pizza chain after allegedly receiving threats on social media . moughni chose to drop the lawsuits after a man made threats against him and his 11 - year - old daughter on facebook and instagram . press and guide moughni had filed lawsuits against little caesars on behalf of michelle meade and her husband , mohamad bazzi , a dearborn couple who said the pizza chain had sold fake halal pizzas at its schaefer road location . in march 2017 , a muslim man named mohamad bazzi sued the company after he said his pizza contained pork even though it was advertised otherwise . bazzi said the pizza he ordered was labeled as halal , which means it meets islamic food consumption standards . he said he and his wife became sick after eating the pizza and realizing the pepperoni on the pizza was pork . halal pepperoni is advertised on the business front window ( below ) . daily caller bazzi s wife says she knew the pepperoni was pork because she is a convert to islam who grew up catholic . bazzi also has experience with pizza ingredients , he says , because he once worked at a pizza joint . in the second lawsuit , two muslim dearborn residents allege they were sold pork pepperoni pizza when they ordered halal pepperoni pizza . they are suing for more than 100 million and allege the number of people affected is in the thousands . completely rejected the plaintiff s claims . the manager of the dearborn pizza place , who was named in the lawsuit , claims he did nothing wrong and that the muslim customer actually asked for a pepperoni pizza with a halal sticker on the box . however , little caesars completely rejected the plaintiff s claims . the manager of the dearborn pizza place , who was named in the lawsuit , claims he did nothing wrong and that the muslim customer actually asked for a pepperoni pizza with a halal sticker on the box . the manager says bazzi ( below ) wanted a pepperoni pizza and the muslim told the employee to put the [ halal ] sticker on the box . based on the manager s claims , it appears that bazzi is straight up lying in an attempt to take advantage of the liberal outrage over islamophobia and enrich himself . what s more , bazzi waited three days after originally eating the pizza before he filed a police report and took action against the third largest pizza chain in the country . by waiting , he was hoping the employee would have forgotten the odd request . two little caesars pizza locations in dearborn had sold halal pepperoni pizza , but the stores on outer drive and schaefer road discontinued the menu item after moughni filed the bazzi s lawsuit in may . after the threats against moughni surfaced recently on social media , he submitted petitions to drop the suits . according to the detroit free press , a man sent moughni an instant message on facebook on oct . 26 that read : you better stop your lawsuit against little caesars you followed by an expletive and racial slur against arabs and blacks . moughni also provided screenshots to the newspaper of photos the man posted on twitter of moughni and his family members with the words : muslim lawyer who wants to sue littlecaesars for 100 , 000 , 000 and his wife s facebook , daughter goes to followed by the name of his daughter s school . the first of three lawsuits moughni brought against the pizza maker was thrown out in september .
graffiti on the city of clovis only muslim house of worship prompted swift community response monday and requests from police for public help in identifying a suspect . ( start with the mosque members ) the damage consisted of the message happy birthday jesus christ from a real christan [ sic ] in red on the building s south - facing wall , christan [ sic ] in red on a sign in the front lawn , and trump , twice on the east - facing front : once on the glass panes of the front door and again to the right of the entrance . mahamadu fuseini has overseen the mosque for about 10 years and said monday this was the first such incident he knows about . police said monday the incident could be considered a hate crime , but declined to say so definitively pending further investigation . it can be ( a hate crime ) , but it depends on what we learn , clovis police department capt . roman romero said monday . we all want to jump to hate crime but maybe this person is just the kind of human being that likes to divide a community . romero said the fact of the letter a being painted to resemble the common symbol for anarchy might have reflected an attempt to start a fight that doesn t need to exist .
twenty - three new bills have been introduced in 18 state legislatures this year to ban the practice of islamic law critics say the aim is to spread fear about muslims . anti - sharia legislation is spreading in state legislatures across the us , as donald trump s hostile stance towards muslims appears to be emboldening rightwing islamophobes critics of the islamization of america . the guardian in 2017 there were 23 new bills introduced in 18 states attempting to prohibit the practice of islamic religious law , or sharia , in us courts . the rash of new bills brings the total number of such legislative efforts since 2010 to 217 in 43 states , according to the haas institute at uc berkeley which monitors the anti - sharia movement . legal experts point out that the bills are superfluous , as the us constitution is the supreme law of the land and any foreign laws are subservient to it . sharia itself is less a set of laws than religious guidelines , one of which requires muslims to be law - abiding according to the rules of whichever country they find themselves . but elsadig elsheikh , director of the global justice program at the haas institute that carried out the research , said the purpose of the bills was to spread fear about muslims living in america and to portray them as untrustworthy and out of step with american values . even if these bills do not become law they help to subject muslims to surveillance and other forms of exclusion and discrimination , he said . ( good ) of the 23 bills introduced to state legislatures this year , only two became law in arkansas and texas . four new states joined the growing list of legislatures where anti - sharia legislation has been attempted : colorado , connecticut , north dakota and wisconsin . all but one of the bills were introduced by republicans . the exception was in idaho where a committee with an unknown party affiliation was behind the move . heidi beirich , an expert on anti - muslim hate groups at the ( widely discredited ) southern poverty law center , sees the rash of state bills as signs that the provocative language coming out of trump s circle is having an impact . at the state level , the number one push for anti - muslim activists is anti - sharia bills . it s a recurrent effort . called trump himselffor all muslims to be barred from entering the us when he was a presidential candidate , a sentiment that he has only barely tempered in his drive for a travel ban on several majority - muslim countries . several of the individuals he chose as key advisers also have a controversial track record . steve bannon , trump s former chief strategist in the white house , once wrote a film script that warned of the country turning into the islamic states of america . the former national security adviser michael flynn called islam a vicious cancer inside all muslims that has to be excised . charles turner , who is researching a doctoral thesis on anti - muslim legislation at the university of utah , said that the plethora of bills had been enabled by trump and his close team . this is an expression of rightwing republicanism that chimes with their populist base . the anti - sharia movement became a force in the us after 2010 in the wake of the furor over the plan to open a muslim community center in downtown manhattan led by pamela geller who dubbed it the ground zero mosque and said it was a beachhead for islamic supremacism . since 2010 a concerted network has been created pushing anti - sharia bills in state legislatures . an anti - muslim lawyer , david yerushalmi , gave a boost to the efforts by composing draft legislation called the american laws for american courts , alac , that has provided the template for at least 140 of the bills that have been introduced . most of the recent bills are careful not to refer overtly to sharia or islam , as to do so would be to expose the legislation to the scrutiny of federal courts on grounds of religious discrimination . instead , they talk of foreign laws being banned in us jurisdictions . none the less , they have the potential to wreak damage . nikiya natale , legal director of the dallas - fort worth chapter of ( designated terrorist group ) cair ( council on american - islamic relations ) , said that anti - muslim sentiment was growing in texas which this year passed its third anti - sharia law .

my sister - in - law , the artist , propped her last painting up , as high as she could reach
i promised myself that if i ever got to this point that if i ever sank so low i would record it , because the world deserves to know , lest we should forget : walmart is a hellish nightmare unfolding right in your own backyard . this is hatesec , reporting live from the bottomless pit of despair , far back at the deep end of american retail hell , situated in a small southern town in the appalachian mountains . first things first : forget everything you ever thought about the rural souls lost 20 years ago to fast food , diabetes and drug addiction . the new walmart is like nothing you ve ever seen before ; it has become an ideological disease sucking out the overripe , ooey - gooey insides of the already sad and lifeless generation x , and they re pulling it out through their fucking eyeballs forget everything you ever saw about people of walmart . if you found that piece of shit book in a barnes noble outside the mall one mile from home , then you didn t see walmart . the people are deformed , sickly and fat . which people the best compliment i can muster for my peers is , hey , your eyes don t look dead yet . what gives and they tell me , well , i guess i just hope that i ll get out of here . and this is normally where we would share a big , hearty gut laugh , if laughter sounded like a repressed sigh , followed by uproarious silence . it s pretty funny , though . i get to watch real , live human beings turn into animals . this is the kind of shit we watch documentaries for . there is a bovine quality to not only the customers about , but my coworkers , too . the younger , spry crowd , fueled either by youth or amphetamines , zip around around the obesity like pocked bees circling a hive , pretending to work . customers and fat , aging managers migrate slowly across the store , fanning out across their territories like the zerg overlord of starcraft . the managers wade smartly , while the customers follow the computer - generated maze designed to maximize profits by running them through a psychological gauntlet of shit they think they might need . there are no windows , no skylights , no clocks . like a casino , walmart is mazelike , timeless and the fluorescence maintains an overall vibe of perpetual night . of course , i sympathize with all these people here . i am not making fun of the despair ; however , if despair is funny to you , then you and i are reading the same article right now . there s a certain absurdity to the level of despair i see at walmart that literally fascinates me in new ways , every single day i go into work . for example , sometimes a wild eyed look overcomes my immediate supervisor s face . he lumbers around , eyes sharply focused on something , like a powerful lioness zeroing in on her kill [ trillions of lions ] matthew , pull some of them 32 - inch tVs and let s get em out on the floor . matthew , proud to receive orders ( to be on a mission ) , gets up from the dirty floor where he has been straightening a wall of cellphone cases , and heads to the back with purpose in his step , shoulders back . he wraps everything in spiderwrap , preventing theft , and fielding questions from consumers who are universally too lazy to read , and are unable to follow simple instructions . we all received a public education , i thought . where do they all come from i can only assume the absence of social programs is to blame for their destitution . paradoxically , what little social programs they seem to access have enabled a massive prescription drug addiction that profoundly hits rural communities across the Us in a way i don t commonly see in the cities . or , i don t know , maybe they re just fucking trash . ha imagine that : people , as trash . human garbage . because i don t have to imagine it , i see it . i live in it . i am just blowing around with the human waste right now . we operate right now on a skeleton crew of about four people in electronics . when a small crowd forms around me as i wait on hold with indian tech support , i address my customers as a single audience . okay , everybody , make note of who came first , second , and so on , and i ll get you in the order you arrived , because as you can see , i am the only person here . i often announce . and i figured out a funny line that usually wins over even the maddest adult babies in line , and it goes like this : and so the next time you see walmart in the new york times posting record profits , everyone remember this moment . now , if you just have a question , line up to the left . i do this every day . the customers say i should be store manager . my coworkers ask how i am so good with people . i don t know what to tell them . i don t care . i don t want to manage walmart . i want to save every dime that shithole gives me and leave when my time is up . i eat ramen because i don t want to work there . i am nice to people because walmart sucks and it s the only way to make it suck less . i have to be nice to people because the retarded joy my customers get from buying electronics is sometimes the only happiness i might see in a day . at least i don t share my coworkers irrational fears of management . i stand up for myself and my people . i have two really , really bad managers who tried to start shit with me and failed . one guy , i gave him three chances but i don t think he knew he used up two of them when he interrupted a conversation i was having with a man about printer cartridges . i did whatever it was he asked , and then found him again . i told him not to interrupt me while i am working , and to use his manners . he tried to race me to the manager s office , like a child , where i registered a formal complaint against him . another manager attacked me for being laid back , and for seeming unapproachable . she complained that i don t smile . i said , i do , but i won t smile at you . and i smiled at her , because it was such a funny thing to say to the bitch . i couldn t help myself . previously that day , i gave two customers my personal cellphone number and i m playing the blues with one of them tomorrow . an aging fellow who asked me to put minutes on his phone for him , and we started talking about music . i was so unapproachable he asked me to join him to play the blues together . it s a horrible place . it s such a really , horrible place and i guess he felt it , too . fuck me . i feel like i ve said pretty much all i can say about walmart except for one thing . remember last year s strike it looked like workers just wanted a little socialized fairness ; at least , that s how it looked from the outside , didn t it you remember that . well , here s what they really wanted . because obamacare had just kicked in last summer . walmart , instead of complying with the intention of the affordable care act to persuade the second - largest employer in the Usa ( behind only the military ) to offer affordable healthcare , doubled down on labor exploitation and shortened the work week to just 32 hours per person , or a paltry 1 , 100 per month after taxes . and , of course , no healthcare . so what were those workers in such an uproar over seems like they d want their healthcare and full - time jobs , right well they wanted their full - time jobs pretty bad , it seems , because that whole strike was not about getting healthcare and a living wage walmart was intentionally denying them , but the big bargain was , just let us work 40 hours again , and keep the healthcare . they needed the money that bad , and there is almost no place to work in areas where walmart is big . walmart is literally at the hub of my small town , as it is many others . could walmart , as a corporation , possibly have its worker base any better right where they want them the socialist feartrip ripping through the country even had me convinced walmart workers were fighting hard for healthcare , when in actuality they wanted walmart to use its power to resist federal law and deny them their own healthcare , just for a chance to work more at walmart , selling even more shit for them . if this sounds stupid or unlikely so far , i ve noticed something about walmart s computers . they re not very old , and came out after obamacare was a thing . on the scheduling software , i can see ( i already work 32 hours , by the way ) a link to take open shifts . these are currently denied by management right now , but all the elements are in place for the walmart strikers to eventually have their way and pick up any open slot that might open up based on computational analysis of shopping patterns and trends by the walmart ordering and scheduling algorithm , which automatically suggests a certain logistical deployment for the store , in three - week chunks , or cycles ; theoretically , in the absence of a store manager , the store could go into auto - pilot , guided only by a proprietary formula designed to maximize profits at the expense of whatever , human sanity . a peripheral cost . working at walmart feels like being at the center of a shitty wagon wheel , and it only drives through shit , and it s just throwing shit all over the spokes , and everyone is in a shitty mood about it , but no one gives a shit enough to do anything about it , and now we re all eating shit and we have shit for brains and a shit culture with shit people who shit all over everything so even the nice stuff that could have been nice is also shitty . walmart makes everything shitty . it hardens people . it turns compassionate people into dead - eyed zombies in a short matter of months . many of my coworkers are dead inside . 18 years . 14 years . 20 years as a retail drone without so much as an offer for promotion because they are too weird , too nice , too dumb , too smart , or too soft for the hardfaced leadership role as a deckhand to the helm of the hate ship . but hey , she s a - sinkin , boys . let s watch her go down not with sadness , but celebration . just too bad about the innocents . so don t feel bad for me . i m not innocent . i m worse than any good - natured , hard - working walmart employee . i m a lazy piece of shit who hates his body and hates himself , and his ideas and his thoughts , and if i die early , it ll make fucking sense and maybe even some people will be happy . so don t feel bad for me . the next time you walk into walmart and i know you will , but deny it all you like be kind to the sad , desperate souls all around you and realize someone definitely treated that person like less of a human being , just because they have to wear that huge , ugly gay blue vest with the words proud walmart associate on the tit . which is really a bit presumptuous for a shirt , don t you think what dreams once lay behind those dead eyes what hopes were dashed , so early on , that this is all there is . i m fine . walmart is fine if you get out , even if that is generally unlike how retail was originally conceptualized . you re stuck here forever fuck . they didn t deserve to die . no one deserves this previously unwritten layer of retail hell . but it s difficult to look at them and think like that . you wouldn t look directly at the sun , would you am i the crazy one for staring at it maybe i m wrong here , but working at walmart fucking sUcKs out loud . stay tuned for a walmart - themed hatestory by the internet s favorite kilgoar , who has watched me work at walmart , and heard and laughed at all my complaints . this expos is brought to you proudly by chronicle . su , your number one source for all things , fulfilling , and true .
it goes without saying at this point that the trump presidency is an incendiary one . the belligerent businessman turned political leader has marked his time in office by lashing out at essentially every interest imaginable , from the nuclear armed north korea to the nation s justice system . both of those cases have produced serious situations ; in the case of the first , trump is credibly accused of obstruction of justice for , among other offenses , firing fbi director james comey , and in the case of the second , the north koreans now claim to have the ability to strike the u . s . , having used trump s incendiary remarks about them as an excuse to continue with their weapons development . considering all of this , the stunning fact that the president is alleged to have had an affair with a porn star and paid her to keep quiet about it is hardly the only thing to worry about in the case of his administration . although rumors and reports about the matter had been publicized for some time , this january , the wall street journal published a new report about the hush money payment allegedly delivered to stormy daniels . now , daniels is capitalizing on her fifteen or more minutes of fame with the making america horny again tour . yes , really . she kicked off this string of club appearances with one in greenville , south carolina , on saturday night , where a women s march had taken place earlier in the day . reporters descended on the strip club where daniels made her appearance , including matt flegenheimer of the new york times , who chronicled his experiences in a report published sunday morning besides the posts he made to his twitter account late saturday and early sunday . according to flegenheimer , daniels avoided direct questions about her relationship with trump , but she did answer questions about what it s been like to be at the center of media attention since the wsj report came out . she apparently hadn t performed since last summer . speaking of her return , she commented : imagine coming back when you re the most insecure . it s the only time i ve ever gone onstage and was actually scared . asked what it had been like to be stormy daniels over the past week , she said that it been stressful and amusing . besides the normal strip club crowd , there were also people at the event like local pub owner suzanne coe , who wanted daniels to sign her copy of author michael wolff s incendiary chronicle of the trump administration , fire and fury . curiously , among other details that flegenheimer related was that at one point , he saw a member of the media relent and let a dancer take them to a back room . other reporters to chronicle their experiences at the event include buzzfeed s john stanton , who quipped on twitter : america , you re one fucked up joint . the president , for his part , has only commented on the issue through his lawyer michael cohen , who has unsurprisingly denied the whole thing . remember besides this alleged extramarital affair , which went on soon after melania had given birth to barron , trump is also credibly alleged to have mistreated numerous women , accusations he has denied . featured image via gabe ginsberg / getty images
a lot of research and study goes into the underwater ecosystems across the world . marine biologists are always conducting some form of excavation or data collection underwater so to understand more thoroughly what species of fish or life exist down there . one particular area of marine biology research is into the cave structures in the ocean . caves are usually pre - historic remnants of some undulation in the earth s crust that produced an air gap , which water then seamlessly flowed into . the unique thing about these caves is that get to see some of the stalactite rocks from thousands of years ago that have remained pretty much the same the entire time . another unique aspect to underwater caves is that some have emerged in such a way that pockets of air exist within them . water may be all around you but some of these research scientists have found caves with little reservoirs in them that allow humans to pop out of the water and breath . research conducted over the past twenties has been focused on finding the largest underwater caves on earth . recently , divers off the coast of mexico have found what they believe to be is the largest underwater cave yet discovered this one particular cave is full of mayan artifacts and prehistoric flora that has not been yet seen or documented by humans . the divers were part of the gran acuifero maya project that is focused on researching and preserving the various marine ecosystems in the yucatan peninsula . it is in this area that a number of cave systems exist from thousands of years ago and it was in these cave systems that divers were exploring to what kind of life is still in existence . the divers were conducting research near the beach town of tulum when they found this one massive cave . the cave system is known as the sac actun . during a regular overview expedition of the caves , the divers noticed an unexpected subaquatic tunnel that actually connected the 163 - mile long sac actun cave with a smaller cave close by the 52 - mile long dos ojos structure . after making this discovery the divers had to re - organize their understanding of the underwater system . they new classified the dos ojos system as part of the sac actun cave , which , as a result , became the largest cave in the world this is an effort of more than 20 years , to travel hundreds of kilometers of caves submerged in quintana roo mainly , of which i dedicated 14 years to explore this monstrous sac actun system ; now everyone s job is to keep it , said the lead explorer of the expedition robert schittner . the really fascinating part from an archaeological perspective was the discovery of mayan artifacts on the floor of the cave . various ceramics and human remains were there , as were many forms of extinct plant life . the discovery will make a big improvement to the knowledge we have of the mayan civilization , which lived for years in the yucatan peninsula but were all but wiped out by the spanish .
the patriotism for this country is evidently much stronger in some people than others . usually , we feel a rush of patriotism on independence day or during the olympics , when american athletes go out and compete against other nations . but to get the chance every once and a while to show our national pride is more of a treat than something par for the course ( after all , we do not have to sing the national anthem every morning like you do in some schools ) . one pilot went out of his way recently to show his support for the american cause . it all occurred when he realized that on his plane were the remains of a soldier who died overseas and his loving family , who had gone over to retrieve them . captain rodriguez began his flight preparations like it was any other day . as he was getting settled in the cockpit , a flight attendant came to him and said , we have an h . r . on this flight . for those who don t know , h . r . stands for human remains . rodriguez quickly asked if the body was from a fallen soldier which it was and if there was an escort for it . when he heard the family was scheduled to be on the plane , he asked for them to be able to board early and have them sent to the flight deck . the captain wanted to make sure he could provide anything the family might need . he shared his experiences of that day on facebook later on . here is the transcript : i just found out the family of the soldier we are carrying , is also on board , she said . she then proceeded to tell me that the father , mother , wife and 2 - year old daughter were escorting their son , husband , and father home . the family was upset because they were unable to see the container that the soldier was in before we left . we were on our way to a major hub at which the family was going to four hours for the connecting flight home to virginia . the father of the soldier told the flight attendant that knowing his son was below him in the cargo compartment and being unable to see him was too much for him and the family to bear . he had asked the flight attendant if there was anything that could be done to allow them to see him upon our arrival . the family wanted to be outside the cargo door to watch the soldier being taken off the airplane . the captain knew it was against protocol , but he also knew he had to do something . he called the dispatcher directly and asked if such a special occasion could be arranged for the family . just two hours before landing he got an answer : yes , a special escort team would come and bring the family to the cargo to see the case . the captain had the message from the dispatcher printed out and sent to the family and it more than made their day , it made their entire year . such a special show of gratitude and patriotism is rare but much appreciated
running a lemonade stand is a rite of passage for any enterprising young kid . and , as kids know , the secret to any good lemonade is balancing the sour lemons with the sweet sugar . a 9 - year - old girl s lemonade stand in ohio was frequented this past week by a sheriff s deputy who , perhaps inspired by the sweetness of the lemonade , gave the girl an even sweeter gift . the sheriff s deputy for lake county zach ropos was passing through painesville , ohio on patrol when he noticed gabrielle s classic lemonade stand . ropos said the moment struck immediately , i see a little girl come running up to my police car , and she hands me a glass , i hand her a few bucks . but ropos was also curious about what gabrielle was hoping to make money for , i asked her what she wanted to do with the money she said she d get an ipad , to help with school and play games . with such worthy reasons for wanting an ipad , and with an obviously strong work ethic , gabrielle impressed officer ropos . not wanting to ruin a potential surprise , he talked to gabrielle s mother and mentioned that he had an old ipad at home he might be able to give to gabrielle . officer ropos was then disappointed to find , when he got home , that his old ipad was beyond repair . i went home that night , fired up the ipad , but it just wasn t updated anymore nothing really worked on it , the officer said . not willing to give up so easily , ropos went back to gabrielle s stand the next day and asked how much she d managed to save . i talked to the little girl , gave her a speech about how courageous and admirable i think her efforts were to save up her money . i asked her how much she saved up and she said she only had a few dollars , ropos said . gabrielle confirmed that the lemonade stand business was not going great , but that was only due to her own kindness . when her mother s gas tank had run empty , gabrielle gave her mother some of her hard - earned lemonade money to help fill up on gas . as a result , she d only managed to save a few dollars toward the ipad . when she told me she gave the money to her mom that s when i almost started crying because of how great of a kid she really was , the officer said . after going to a local store and asking if they d chip in for a tablet for gabrielle with him , ropos showed up to surprise gabrielle and her mother . the sweetness of the moment , filmed by ropos co - worker , is almost too much . gabrielle can barely contain her excitement her lemonade stand had paid off . ropos was almost equally as touched , she just wouldn t stop hugging me seeing her face is how i remember christmas when i was 5 years old . she couldn t stop smiling . her smile was worth a million dollars . the 9 - year - old may not have made a million dollars at her lemonade stand but she still got her ipad . the responses to such a beautiful story were numerous , as readers shared their comments on the mad world news facebook page . one person wrote , outstanding compassion by this dedicated officer , more of these thoughtful stories should be circulated , well done . another commented , may god bless this officer for being so kind to this little girl . in a time when the news about police officers is often sour , it is nice to be reminded that there is always sweetness in there too .
landon is a man unlike the rest of us . after a traumatic car accident , landon was rescued by paramedics , plunged into a coma where he technically died three times , but came back to tell this tale . landon has been to heaven . as his mother drove home with his father in the passenger seat , in the summer of 1997 , landon was but a small child in the seat behind his mother . crossing an intersection , their car was hit by ambulance returning back to its station . julie , landon s mother , said she had no idea what was happening , i didn t see the ambulance coming , but i remembered him [ her husband ] yelling . that was the last thing i heard from him . landon s father died immediately but paramedics were able to stabilize julie . at this point , no one knew there was a kid in the backseat . they couldn t see his body because of the damage that was done to the driver s side of the car , julie said . eventually , landon s exposed show came to the attention of the paramedics who swiftly pulled his body from the wreckage and air - lifted him to a nearby hospital . lifeless and not breathing , landon s body was far from a hopeful sight . he died two times in that first day at the hospital , and the chances of his survival , even as a child unable to walk , talk , or eat , were minimal . julie s attitude was the following ; i was so desperate that that was okay . i would take that just to have him . he was all that i had . the funeral of landon s father and julie s husband only further reinforced this point . landon was all that julie had to live for . i was very disappointed . heartbroken , she said . and while i m sitting at the funeral , i m fussing at god . i don t understand why this happened . i don t understand why he didn t send angels to protect us , but in the very next breath i m praying as hard to him as i ve ever prayed in my life for landon to live . the immense trauma landon had suffered was concentrated on his head . still in a coma , he was hooked up to many machines that were trying desperately to keep him alive . time seemed to stand still as julie waited , and prayed . two weeks later , a miracle occurred . landon woke up from the coma and , on the hospital bed , opened his eyes to his mother . somehow he suffered no brain damage . julie was thrilled but now she had to break the news to landon about his father . she tentatively asked , do you know where your dad is at landon s reply would shock us all . yes i know where he s at . i saw him in heaven . landon s journey to heaven happened when he died for the third time in his coma . meeting jesus was a life - changing and life - giving experience . he says that jesus told me that i have to go back to earth and be a good christian and tell others about him . that s exactly what landon is doing now . landon s message to us is the following : i know i m doing it for jesus . i know that he s real , i know that angels are there . i know that there s a heaven . i m not doing it for someone i don t know or that i ve never seen . i ve seen jesus . i know he s there . he s asked me to do this and this is what i m doing . as inspiring as the miracle of landon s multiple deaths is , his mission in life should be just as inspiring to all of us .
the president and his team have long used the u . s . armed forces as a political football , so to speak , having claimed , for instance , that nfl football players choosing to take a knee during pre - game national anthems were disrespecting current and former members of the military , along with the country as a whole . those claims came in the face of the fact that service members don t fight for a piece of cloth ; they fight for , if we re talking about something other than the actual lives of the people of the united states , rights like the right to free speech . now , members of the trump administration are at it again . this time , the issue arose when vice president mike pence took a trip to the middle east . while there , he delivered a speech to american service members near the syrian border that quickly proved to be a political spectacle , with the vice president seemingly attempting to drum up opposition to the democrats while speaking to the troops . as we re all well aware of by now , the federal government has shut down due to senators inability to pass an appropriations bill before saturday dawned . the main point of contention between democrats and republicans was , and remains , the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young people protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , program , which the trump administration has moved to end . this provided the context for the vice president s remarks to some of our overseas troops on sunday . after some initial vague platitudes about how much he and trump support the military , pence commented : i m sure you re all aware of what s happening in washington , d . c . despite bipartisan support for a budget resolution , a minority in the senate has decided to play politics with military pay . but you deserve better . you and your families shouldn t have to worry for one minute about whether you re going to get paid as you serve in the uniform of the united states . that s not the point , pence . it s the republicans who are refusing to allow for protections for those provided for under daca to be extended in essentially any form , and it s the republicans repeated refusals that have made it so that the issue of funding important items like military pay and the future of daca are tied up with each other . if pence wants to be in line with reality , then he can t just pin responsibility for the government shutdown and subsequent stalled military pay on the democrats . ironically , it s a democratic u . s . senator claire mccaskill who proposed a bill that would provide for military pay until the government re - opens . it s a republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who shot that bill down , as the los angeles times reports . pence didn t mention any of that in his remarks to the troops , instead going on to insist that they re not going to reopen negotiations on illegal immigration until the federal government re - opens . numerous interests blasted the vice president for using his time with troops overseas to stage a political spectacle . conservative commentator bill kristol called the vice president s behavior a scene more appropriate to a banana republic . the vice president uses american troops abroad as political props and tweets : potus i and the american people are not GoinG to put up witH it . one assumes pence is merely indulging in vulgar tough - guy rhetoric . but in fact it is a scene more appropriate to a banana republic . < URL > bill kristol ( billkristol ) january 21 , 2018 journalist carl prine called pence s remarks the wrong message at the wrong forum . this was the wrong message at the wrong forum . troops might get used to being props and political footballs , but all administrations should preserve civil - military norms . pence knows better . i d say the same if a democrat did it . < URL > carl prine ( carlprinetweets ) january 21 , 2018 check out video of pence s remarks below . featured image via screenshot from the video
after muslims quietly buy up at least half the homes in a new joppatowne area housing complex , they tell the local townspeople that the community will be open to everyone , knowing full well that once half the complex is muslim only , nobody else will buy homes there . baltimore sun last spring , members of the silver spring - based majlis ansarullah Usa celebrated the groundbreaking of the ansar housing complex , according to photos and information the organization posted on the internet . they have since been removed . community angst has been sparked by information posted on the internet this summer that rivers run is being marketed as a community for muslim families . the complex is billed as a mini - peace village for ahmadi muslims , and members of the ahmadiyya muslim community who are 55 or older would get priority in purchasing houses , according to the majlis ansarullah Usa website . muslim community leader told a crowd of about 200 people tuesday night that the ansar housing complex being built in joppatowne will be open to anyone who wants to buy a house there , refuting concerns from residents and elected officials that it would be for muslims only . he said a community center is planned for the development , which will be used for social , educational and religious purposes . yes we plan to pray there , he said . we also plan to open it up to all of you so you can pray there as well . ( craP . he knows perfectly well that no one but muslims will be able to pray there . community center is just an islamic pseudonym for mosque ) a lawsuit was filed because the county is no longer issuing building permits , according to the complaint . the plaintiffs allege county officials and state legislators have engaged and continue to engage in a conspiracy to discriminate on the basis of religion in land use and housing in violation of federal and state law . motivated by and in direct response to anti - islamic sentiments expressed by certain public officials and certain members of the community , and without any lawful basis , harford county has refused to issue building permits to the plaintiffs , according to the suit . mustafa m . sidik , a joppa resident who identified himself as a muslim , said opposing a development because a particular religious group settles there isn t right . so , what i m saying is , if you guys have a problem with this being a muslim community you should take a long hard look on yourselves , he said .
what trump must do about north korea january 25 , 2018 efforts to prevent north korea from obtaining nuclear weapons has been a football game - one now leaving us with our backs up against our own goal line . we are at a critical point in deciding whether we will act or accept defeat . what we are failing to fully grasp , however , is where the real threat from a nuclear - armed pyongyang lies . ironically , it is not directly from north korea . despite signing an armistice ending the korean war in 1953 , pyongyang embarked upon an aggressive foreign policy , eventually moving the ball forward into the nuclear arms arena . meanwhile , our offense consisted of a series of laterals and punts as administration after administration left its successor to resolve the nuclear issue . president barack obama ' s failed policy toward pyongyang of " strategic patience " was of no help - a policy translated by the north to mean " go for it , " as evidenced by its tremendous gains during his presidency . with time running out on the game clock , president donald trump has two options . one is to take a knee in the end zone , accepting defeat , allowing pyongyang to achieve its nuclear goal . but doing so leaves us in the precarious position of having to rely on " a wing and a prayer " it will not use its nuclear arsenal against us or our allies . realistically , pyongyang would not do so . north korean leader kim jong - un sufficiently cherishes his own life not to initiate a nuclear first strike . he knows a retaliatory u . s . strike would end his family ' s dynasty . but that does not alleviate the problem . of equal value to kim is money . he recognizes a great financial reward can be made selling nuclear weapons . we must realize , therefore , allowing pyongyang to have nuclear weapons means accepting the fact such devices would make their way into the hands of enemies known and unknown . terrorist groups desiring such devices would seek to sneak one into the u . s . with the help of a well - paid drug cartel compromising our borders . much of iran ' s nuclear development program is linked to north korea ' s . iranian scientists have attended many of pyongyang ' s nuclear and missile tests . as the leading state sponsor of terrorism and as a deep pocket for the terrorist group hezbollah , which has close links with the mexican drug cartels , tehran has helped fund kim ' s nuclear program . the mullahs would see a nuclear device from kim as a gift from allah . thus , trump ' s first option leaves america at risk that , at some future date , we will be threatened by or become the victim of a nuclear attack . trying to locate such a device would be the equivalent of playing " where ' s waldo " with a nuclear bomb . therefore , the only option capable of stopping pyongyang is making clear trump will throw the long pass - a surgical military strike to quickly neutralize kim ' s ability to retaliate against us or our allies . while it will be costly , it is absolutely necessary . hopefully , just the immediate threat of the pass will suffice . this past week , observers were pleased to see north korea participate in talks with south korea , breathing a sigh of relief war has been averted . feeding into this perception is pyongyang ' s commitment to participate in the winter olympic games being hosted in the south next month . in a propaganda " puff " piece , the government - controlled north korean media even touts this as a step towards reunification . while hopeful critics look for the positive from these talks , reality suggests otherwise . undoubtedly , the chinese and russians have coached pyongyang to participate in the talks and the games . kim gives up relatively little by doing so , while making it appear he is taking a big step toward seeking peaceful resolution . the reality , however , is pyongyang has two objectives in mind : 1 ) seeking to establish a false sense it is open to negotiation on its nuclear program , which the u . s . demands must go ; and 2 ) seeking to play seoul against washington , knowing the former will likely veto the latter ' s call for military action . south koreans know they easily fall within range of north korean artillery . but they have known this for decades and refused to do anything about it . when president jimmy carter withdrew most u . s . forces from the south in 1977 , the u . s . gave seoul an action plan to protect itself . it included relocating important government ministries further south , constructing bunkers to protect citizens and acquiring a missile defense system . not only has little been done to prepare for this , much of the funding seoul could have used to achieve it was given pyongyang either in the form of aid or cash - the latter for north korea agreeing to hold two summit meetings in 2000 and 2007 that achieved nothing . the north koreans are experts at playing both the americans and the south koreans for fools . president bill clinton fell victim to this , believing he had achieved a framework agreement with the north in 1994 . however , the deal was only used by pyongyang to buy time to further advance its nuclear program , resulting in another u . s . lateral . so confident of a peaceful resolution with pyongyang was clinton , he opted to forego deployment of president ronald reagan ' s proven strategic defense initiative ( " star war " ) technology - which would have protected us today from north korean missiles . but he also acquiesced to a request pyongyang made in 2000 that dishonored our own navy . thirty - two years earlier , north korean patrol boats attacked and captured the uss pueblo - an intelligence ship operating in international waters - imprisoning her crew . the crew was released a year later , but the north still kept the ship as an illicit war trophy . clinton allowed the north to move the pueblo - which remains on the navy ' s active roles to this day - from wonsan harbor on its east coast , up the taedong river - a transit of 1 , 000 miles through international waters - unchallenged by our navy , for public display in pyongyang . the only reason the north entered talks last week with the south is to further its nuclear agenda . seoul , having done nothing for decades to defend itself against its northern bully , will encourage trump to take a knee in the end zone . hopefully , the president , realizing what now is at stake , will recognize time is of the essence to do otherwise . a version of this piece also appeared on < URL >

since donald j . trump proclaimed himself a stable genius , many in the media have openly mocked him , but now some of the world s leading psychologists and neurologists have uncovered some surprising characteristics of a stable genius that just may support the american president s claims after all . here are the top 5 signs you re secretly a stable genius 5 . you re great at naming things . an individual with superior intellect often possess incredible creativity , particularly when it comes to naming things . however according to leading research a true genius is someone who thinks entirely outside the box , such as naming things after something unexpected like their own last name , or calling their offspring after their own first name . also the repeated use of the same name in branding and marketing is also the sign of someone with a wide range of vocabulary . 4 . you always take others advice , regardless of what it is or who it s coming from . stable geniuses set themselves apart from your everyday run - of - the - mill geniuses by always being willing to take outside advice from anyone , regardless of the individual s personal beliefs or ulterior motives , especially when it comes to leaders of other superpowers . you re quick to see the value of a diverse range of opinions from neo - nazis to white supremacists to child molesters , but you re also the kind of stable genius who understands the value of agreeing with whoever spoke last and / or loudest . 3 . you have the ability to watch multiple televisions at the same time , and insist on doing so . another extensive report from cable channel fox news revealed that scientists are now convinced that watching multiple televisions or screens at the same time while absorbing all the relevant information is a sign of someone with superhuman cognitive abilities . as of yet , noted neurologists claim it is a skill only found in leaders of the free world and security camera watchmen . 2 . you only antagonize unstable foreign dictators . this one is very important , as antagonizing leaders of other world nations is nOt considered the hallmark of stable geniuses . however , by picking on an extremely unstable leader , preferably of some foreign nuclear power or other , you display a quiet confidence of your undoubted mental strength over other less ingenious , less dangerous leaders . in short , asserting your dominance over an unstable idiot is by far the best way to prove you are the opposite . 1 . you tweet about how much of a stable genius you are . yes it sounds obvious but scientists insist that the number one sign that you are a stable genius is to tweet about how much of a stable genius you are . this goes back to einstein s time , dr . rita bernstein , president of the american psychological association , explained . albert was known to run through the town at night around 3 am , screaming about how much of a genius he was , matched only by his finely balanced mental state . indeed , as the great stephen hawking famously once said , people who boast about their i . q . are geniuses . did you know the bsj is now on the internet please follow us on facebook and twitter , or support us on patreon
the government , as of sunday afternoon , remains shutdown , after senators were unable to reach an agreement to fund the government in time to keep it from closing due to lack of appropriations as saturday dawned . negotiations stalled over one main point the fate of the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the u . s . as children and until the trump administration moved to end the program were protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca program . a judge ruled that the trump administration must continue accepting daca protections renewal applications for the time being , although the program is still headed towards an ending date . if the program is allowed to expire , it could open the door to the mass deportations that trump promised during his rise to power , and democrats obviously aren t going to go along with that . democrats want to negotiate a plan to protect those whose security is threatened , thanks to the president moving to end daca , and some republicans want to go along with those negotiations , but members of leadership , including the president , aren t interested . south carolina republican u . s . senator lindsey graham is one of those republicans interested in negotiations with democrats , and he s furious that the president s advisers particularly the controversial stephen miller keep undercutting congressional plans for moving forward on plans to deal with the end of daca in a way that s optimal for all involved . on sunday , before going into a meeting of moderate senators , graham relayed his frustrations to reporters . reporter robert costa posted that graham suggested there s a possibility of a breakthrough soon , while at the same time making it clear that he can t stand that stephen miller is involved . reporter igor bobic posted a similar observation , writing : walking into moderates meeting , graham blasts wh staff , and calls out stephen miller by name , for undercutting president by pitching proposals he doesn t support . he offered a quote from graham about the matter , writing that he d spoken as follows : every time we have a proposal , it is only yanked back by staff members . as long as stephen miller is in charge of negotiating on immigration , we are going nowhere . miller , who has long been controversial , has actually already figured prominently in the debates surrounding the government shutdown . remember the recent meeting on immigration policy at the white house , where the president is reported to have referred to countries including haiti , el salvador , and some african nations as shithole countries that meeting which helped push the government towards a shutdown since nothing constructive came of it ended surprisingly poorly for the senators who were there , and there have been reports that stephen miller is part of the reason for that . the senators including lindsey graham had been in contact with the white house ahead of their trip to the premises to present a plan favoring immigrants from the places that the president eventually called shithole countries , and before they made it there , they got the impression that the president was on their side . then , however , advisers like stephen miller and his chief of staff , john kelly , got to him , and the president ended up effectively cursing out the senators . for now , few specifics of any currently under development plans are available for public consideration , and we have to wait and see when it will be that the nation s leaders can come up with something and get the government functioning again . featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images

subscribe to canada free press for free panic mode schumer offers to fully fund the wall , regrets it immediately , retracts offer last week , you may have heard rumblings of a last - minute deal . the hope was that we d all be able to avoid the not - at - all - phony horror of a government shutdown if both sides worked together . we don t know all the details of this supposed detente , but one thing did leak : chuck schumer had offered to fund the border wall in exchange for daca protections . now , i know what you re thinking . there s simply no way on earth you could trust democrats to uphold their end of that bargain . you re right , the offer was probably phony , or came with so many attached strings that construction would never come to pass . still , that was the word on the street . schumer was on board with the evil , racist , wall . as you heard in any one of a thousand panic - stricken news reports , the government ended up shutting down . last night , news broke that schumer s offer had been yanked off the table . from cnn : senate democratic leader chuck schumer withdrew funding for president donald trump s border in negotiations over immigration issues with the white house , according to a democratic aide . a staffer who works for schumer called the white house on monday and said the proposal , which schumer put on the table during a friday meeting with trump , was no longer operative , the aide said . trump invited schumer to the white house on friday over lunch to negotiate a deal for a funding bill , which was being held up over a fight for commitments to address the expiring deferred action for childhood arrivals program . schumer s people are trying to claim that this is nothing new . they say the offer was revoked saturday , not monday , and it was invalidated once it was clear that no deal would be reached . but is anyone really buying that of course not . i d be willing to bet that the actual course of events went like this : schumer makes the offer to fund the wall as reported . he planned to use this offer to look magnanimous and above - the - fray while simultaneously slinging mud at republicans . they were supposed to catch all sorts of hell from the shutdown , and schumer would be in the middle of it saying : hey , i offered to pay for the wall in exchange for daca , but these racist extremists hate hispanics so much that they didn t take the deal . unfortunately for schumer , the blame game didn t pan out . instead of republicans taking the heat , schumer ended up under the microscope . dems freaked out , and his planned spartacus - style crusade ended early . schumer caved and tossed dreamers under the bus . that , coupled with rumors that he was willing to fund the wall , enraged the very illegals he s sworn to protect . so , yesterday , his people made a big show out of having revoked the deal ( which had always been a non - starter anyway ) as a way of placating his angry base . it s not going to work . schumer is learning what we ve been saying all along . they ve tied their party too closely to an increasingly unpopular immigration movement . their base , at the party s urging , has moved further and further to the left on the issue , while moderates watch and wonder what the heck is going on . if hillary had been elected , the radical left wouldn t have been an issue , but they re now a party out of power and their most fervent members have been whipped into an army of frankenstein monsters . if they don t keep the mob happy , the mob will turn . . . .

the subject of gavin mcinnes being fired from the news outlet he created because of a piece he wrote was brought to my attention today through justine tunney s article in defense of gavin mcinnes . as a transwoman myself , i completely identify with tunney s words , however unpopular they may be . not because i m transgendered , but simply because she s right . she speaks of freedom of expression and press , and as a journalist it frightens me that we can be torn from our own publication , have our families targeted and threatened with financial ruin by a mob of hysterical speech - hating cretins , simply for the words we write . the public forums with integrated up / down - voting mechanisms for discussion , such as reddit , showed a rise in the idea that you could lessen the value of speech with the press of a button , not because it was wrong or because you rebutted with a superior counter - argument , rather because you just don t like what you re reading . it s this mentality that has seeped into the minds of most people using the internet , and it s truly a testament to a willing erosion of our rights to express ourselves . when it becomes not about discussion , dialogue and diversity of opinion , but instead about censoring what we don t agree with ( along with trying to destroy the other persons life ) , we have truly lost our way . i was featured in an article in VicE about a trolling organization i was a part of , known as the rustle league . in the article i openly support the westboro baptist church , not because i agree with them , but because they are one of the final bastions of freedom of speech in america and i will defend , to my death , their right to protest as many fags as they want . i also received threats because of that article . before that , i was included on an australian television show about internet trolling , where i was portrayed as the devil incarnate as a crowd of onlookers passed judgement before the show had even begun , not for what i said or had said , but because it could be said . the following week , i did an interview as a companion piece to the airing of the television show and the amount of vitriol spewed toward me in the comment section far exceeded anything i have ever said or done , but god bless them for saying it . it s unfortunate the website had to close the comments section down because of the influx of troll - hating trolls being trolled into trolling , it made for quality trolling . my tenure on the internet spans from the mid - nineties to present and the amount of hatred directed towards me in a week is more than some people get in a lifetime . does it bother me no . why because we all have a right to our opinions . what does bother me , however , is how quickly people will be there to try to take that right away and most of all , how successful they are . love it or leave it , just don t delete it .
the suffering and abuse that someone who has been in a narcissistic relationship has gone through is very real . just because someone is not being attacked physically does not mean they are not being abused . sometimes you cannot see the scars abuse leaves and there is nothing wrong with getting yourself out of an abusive situation be it emotional or otherwise . below you will find a list of things i know many narcissistic abuse survivors want their abusers to know and understand . while most of these things will never actually be said , bringing them to life in this way is empowering to say the least . 6 things survivors of narcissistic abuse want their abusers to know : 1 . i do not belong to you . as someone who has been through narcissistic abuse , i know now that i do not belong to anyone but myself . i am not property . i am my own person and no one can take away the things that make me who i am on the inside . 2 . i have learned my lesson , and you were a mistake . i have learned my lesson , you were not meant for me and you were nothing but a con artist . my heart was never at home with you , you were just wasting my time . i have learned so much from overcoming my attachment for you . 3 . i am better for having overcome your abuse . i am a better person now than i was before . i have managed to overcome so much and in that find myself on a whole new level . nothing will hold me back any longer . i feel sorry for you because you will never know what it feels like to truly love someone and you don t deserve to know that feeling anyway . you will always go through life living in that cycle and i was able to break the cycle . i have accomplished everything you never could . 5 . you did not break me . let s get this one straight : you never broke me . you pushed me to my breaking point and somehow i was able to push back and overcome the abuse you put me through . you were never there in the ways i needed you to be and i managed to get through the bad points all the same . i am a strong woman . you have never deserved to have me in your life . you are not good enough for me . i deserve so much more than you could ever offer . once we accept these things and give power to them in their most authentic forms we can learn to understand how much stronger we truly are . our abusers are the ones missing out . we have managed to do so much and overcome far more than they ever will .
have you ever noticed those orbs lingering on old photos what do you think they are depending on who you ask you will get tons of different answers . while lots of people will say they are just dust particles or mere drops of moisture on the lens , i believe they are something more . they are spheres of energy . while most orbs will be white in color , they can be found in a variety of colors . these orbs are spirits from those passes and our guardians from above . these spirits are generally harmless and are only making themselves known in minuscule ways . capturing orbs in your photos should not be something that brings about fear , it should make you feel better knowing those guiding you on your path are always by your side . below you will find a list of meanings that go along with each different color orb you may see . clear or transparent orbs these are the most common and simply mean that a spirit is trying to make itself known . when this happens you may even become overwhelmed with a specific emotion . do not be alarmed , the spirit is just making sure you know it is there . purple orbs these orbs hold information . for those who do not know purple is a very spiritual color . when you see orbs of this color orb you need to really question things within . green orbs green orbs represent healing and are generally associated with love and kindness . if you see this color orb you are on the right track . the spirit world is letting you know there are good things to come . yellow orbs these orbs should signify that you need to be cautious in life . your angels are warning you of something to come . be very aware . white or silver orbs these orbs are very positive in energy . they are offering you protection from negative things in your life . if you notice these kinds of orbs you might want to stop and thank your spirit guides for what they are working towards doing for you . black orbs black orbs are a sign of danger . when you see these in photos you need to be cautious . the danger is much more imminent in this color . red orbs red or orangeish red orbs represent safety . if you see these colored orbs you are where you need to be . from these you can draw great strength . have you ever seen a spirit orb before and if so what color was the one you saw i see them quite frequently and mine are usually clear or white .

housing market supply and demand : just the facts headline : bitcoin blockchain searches exceed trump blockchain stocks are next by dave kranzler , investment research dynamics : housing people are insane if they think housing isn t going to get crushed with rising rates . as you outline often , it s already happening in ( ny , den , etc . ) i live in la and most of my friends / coworkers are telling me how dumb i am to not jump in . i know to just stay quiet , but i think they are about to walk into a buzz saw ( again ) . email from a subscriber the national association of realtors reports that december existing home sales fell more than the nar led its wall street lap - dogs to believe they would decline . larry yun , the nar s market elf , has been blaming phlegmatic housing sales over the last two years on low inventory . there s only one problem with this assertion : it s not true based on historical data : the chart above is drawn from data that the fed , for some inexplicable reason , purged from its fred database . it illustrates the inverse relationship generally that exists between inventory and sales . the bigger factor driving the economics of the housing market right now is the deteriorating financial condition of any household that might want to buy a house . the fed and government have largely exhausted the population of would - be mortgagees that can make a 0 - 3 down payment on a conventional mortgage plus carry the monthly burden of servicing that mortgage . the tax advantage from deducting real estate taxes was stripped from the equation . i suspect the fed is getting worried about the housing market . the fed s Qe holdings rose 5 billion last week . the entire increase is attributable to an increase in mortgage holdings . not only is the fed not reducing its balance sheet , it felt compelled to inject capital into the mortgage market . one thing to keep in mind . a large percentage of homes purchased and financed with 0 - 3 down payment mortgages in the last couple of years are underwater . when a buyer puts almost nothing down on a mortgage - financed home , the transaction costs all - in are about 10 of the value of the home . these homes are underwater at closing . except in certain bubble areas , homes have not appreciated in value enough to make up for the amount that low down payment buyers are underwater when they closed . when the stock market eventually tanks , it will take home values down at least 30 - 40 , and possibly more . just like any market bubble , i believe the housing market is reaching the point of exhaustion . as households continue to get squeezed financially , there will be a lot of homes put on the market hoping for last year s price . as i ve mentioned before , when home prices are rising quickly , there s an oversupply of buyers . when home prices start to drop , the buyers disappear . when prices are rising continuously , it s very easy to sell a home . when prices begin to fall , it becomes difficult to sell a home . it s been very easy to sell a home for the last 5 + years . i believe it s going to start to become difficult to sell a home at current general price levels . the smartest sellers will price their home to move . this will begin the process of re - pricing the market lower , which in turn could trigger a flood of flipper homes to hit the market just like 2007 / 2008 . read more investmentresearchdynamics . com source : < URL >

when we look around us , our eyes are met with reality as we know it . we see our house , our career , our friends and family and the person that we have essentially become over time . we may be happy with this reality , or we may look upon our current state wishing we had made different decisions or gone in a different direction . when all is said and done , however , the fact is that it is reality and that is all that we have . or is it there are a number of well - known and respected scientists and brilliant minds that believe that there is more to reality than the linear belief that what is and always has been will continue to be in the future . rather than accepting that there is one path , one past that is behind us , they subscribe to the belief of multiple realities created through the decisions that we take when faced with a crossroad . as stephen hawking explains in the grand design , quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present , the ( unobserved ) past , like the future , is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities . the universe , according to quantum physics , has no single past , or history . in this book , he discusses a powerful theory about the possibility of a multiverse , in which each decision we make sets two separate versions of reality into existence . for example , if you were faced with the decision of pursuing your dream career in another country or staying at home to start a family with your partner , following this theory there would be two realities created from this one choice one in which you go and one in which you stay . interested image via imgur

modern technology has brought us many things , including social media . and as social media has slowly but surely taken the world by storm , so too has it taken over our lives . from iconic moments in our lives to even the smallest of accomplishments like cooking dinner , it seems as though everyone is sharing everything . and while this may or may not be a good thing , one thing holds true : if you are an avid social media user , it s likely that you use it to mark every aspect of your life . with that being said , entering into a relationship could possibly be one of the major hallmarks of human life , other than marriage and having children , or starting a new career . because of this , in modern times , it seems that a couple isn t officially together until they have made the jump on facebook . psychology today refers to this as going facebook official , and while they provide many pros to going official , they also note a very dark side to this coin as well . according to the article , various studies have found that couples who share photos of themselves together were also happier . furthermore , those that disclosed their relationship status on facebook enjoyed stronger relationships . sadly , however , as the huffington post notes , facebook relationships are not always sunshine and rainbows . think about it : facebook is almost an archive of your entire life , including past loves , photos , questionable friends of the opposite sex and more . while some couples may be able to overlook this downside , it can create a very negative opportunity for jealousy , distrust , and misunderstanding . furthermore , in an abusive relationship ( verbal or physical ) social media can provide the abusive partner with ample opportunity to not only stalk but to cyber - abuse their partner . according to borrajo et al . ( 2015 ) , cyber dating abuse is defined by monitoring and surveillance of a romantic partner or ex - partner , posting humiliating photos and making rude of threatening comments . now , with facebook offering Gps features and location sharing , you can see exactly how easily it can be used by a controlling partner to manipulate their victim . and while social media doesn t seem to be going anywhere , if you have a partner who abuses this aspect of your lives , it may be time to send them packing . from time to time , we may all facebook stalk our partners , however , there is a fine line to be drawn for how we use this information . jealousy is a normal part of a relationship , however , cyber abuse is not with the world being full of potential partners , do not waste your time on someone who is an opportunist for control and manipulation featured image via the today show

the federal government , as you re no doubt aware of by now , shut down last friday night . the house of representatives had passed a spending bill to keep the government open , but the senate could not come to an agreement in time , although they did hold a vote on a spending measure . the senate has still not come to an agreement as of sunday , although they should hold another vote soon . the differences between involved parties on how to best go forward didn t go away once the government shutdown , and now , there s been a perhaps surprising difference of opinion exposed between senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and the president himself . mcconnell and trump have found themselves at odds in the past , most notably over the fate of the gop s efforts to repeal the affordable care act . trump blamed the failure of those efforts on mcconnell in a series of tweets , with the two of them eventually trying to downplay their feud by holding a joint press conference . this time around , the two men differ in their opinions about employing the nuclear option as a way to move beyond the present budget stalemate that s prompted the government to shut down . early sunday , trump tweeted a message reading : great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border . the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked . if stalemate continues , republicans should go to 51 ( nuclear option ) and vote on real , long term budget , no c . r . s to begin with , no , democrats do not just want undocumented immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked . democrats wouldn t support past gop spending bills because they didn t include protections for the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants currently in the u . s . these people had been protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , program , but the trump administration has moved to end that program . there s a significant difference between democrats actual stance and what trump is asserting that their stance is . as for trump s proposal to use the nuclear option and make it so that only 51 votes are needed to pass a budget bill and not the present 60 , the senate has actually used such a tactic in the past , just not in the case of budget bills . early last year , the senate changed the rules so that trump supreme court nominee neil gorsuch could be confirmed with only 51 votes . this time around , however , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not on board with the idea to again change senate rules . reuters reports that , according to a spokesperson for the senator , the republican conference opposes changing the rules on legislation . it s not even a given that republicans would have the votes to pass spending legislation if they did change the rules , with a handful of republicans having voted with the democrats on the legislation that s already been proposed . a handful of democrats voted with the republicans , but not enough to put it over the edge . meanwhile , the trump white house has proven as unhelpful as the president s tweet suggests , with their major contribution so far to the negotiations being a statement calling democrats obstructionist losers . featured image via alex wong / getty images
the federal government remained shut down going into monday morning , with large numbers of federal employees having to go into work only to get the official notice of their furlough . senators were unable to reach a deal in time to keep the government from shutting down as saturday dawned , so now , large parts of the federal workforce have their acute futures in question . at the same time , important programs like the children s health insurance program , or chip , remain on shaky ground at best , with republicans having pushed off renewing funding for the program long enough to get it tied up in the present debates . republican leaders like vice president mike pence have touted the negative effects of the shutdown , such as the fact that it puts a stall on military pay . why , then , has the gop not yet moved for a deal with democrats to get the government re - opened the answer , according to the new york times , is in the form of two names john kelly and stephen miller . trump tapped kelly , who was at the time serving as secretary of homeland security , to be his chief of staff after the abrupt departure of rnc official reince priebus from the position . miller who has long been controversial has been a trump adviser for some time , having served alongside steve bannon . the times describes the situation with these two men as follows : [ t ] wice over the past two weeks , mr . trump has privately told lawmakers he is eager to strike a deal to extend legal status to the so - called dreamers , only to have his chief of staff , john f . kelly , and senior policy adviser , stephen miller , make clear afterward that such a compromise was not really in the offing unless it also included a host of stiffer immigration restrictions . it s the status of the dreamers that has occupied a central position in the fight over the future of government funding . the dreamers are those who are protected under the deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , program , which protects undocumented immigrants brought here as young children from deportation . trump has moved to end that program and possibly open the door to mass deportations , something the democrats can t let happen . publicly , trump has framed democrats wanting to protect dreamers as them supporting a massive influx of supposedly dangerous illegal immigrants . on twitter on sunday for instance , trump claimed on twitter that dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked . he has not , however , always kept up that stern about - face , and has seemed at times ready to make a deal . however , the president s willingness has come out of a seeming certain misunderstanding of the fundamentals of immigration policy , something that was put on display during a recent public meeting between the president and members of the senate . democratic senator dianne feinstein said during that meeting that she wanted a clean daca bill , and trump agreed until being reminded by gop majority leader kevin mccarthy that a clean daca bill is something without , essentially , any concessions from the democrats for the increased border security that republicans want . gop senator lindsay graham is among those who have bemoaned the influence of the president s staffers pulling him back from a deal at key times of uncertainty , communicating his frustrations with stephen miller s involvement in negotiations to reporters on sunday . for now , the question of when the government will re - open remains just that a question . the president , meanwhile , is continuing to rant on twitter about the whole thing . featured image via jabin botsford / the washington post via getty images

expand collapse ( photo : baca ) a hindu mob burned a church and christian - owned businesses at jammu and kashmir , india , january 2018 . a mob led by apparent hindu nationalists burned down a church and shops belonging to christians in india ' s northern state of jammu and kashmir after the death of a woman , whom the mob believed was forcibly converted to christianity . a large group of hindus resorted to violence last week in the rajouri district bordering pakistan after a local man , rinku kumar , brought the body of his 25 - year - old wife , seema devi , for a christian burial , according to Ucan news . devi ' s family falsely claimed that their daughter was forced to convert to christianity by her husband and was murdered by him . according to the british asian christian association , one of devi ' s uncles told a local newspaper that " she could not have willingly quit her hindu faith . " but baca reported that devi had become a christian over two years ago , years after her husband converted to christianity . she became sick just days after their marriage but was healed during a church service , baca said . two years later , however , the illness returned and she died on jan . 15 . when kumar brought her body from punjab state to jammu and kashmir to be buried , news of the burial spread and incited violence . hindu fanatics from extremist group bajran dal and a mob of over 300 people sought revenge the next day by smashing sehal christ church and setting it on fire . christians attending the church for prayer were beaten , with 12 seriously injured . businesses that were owned by christians were also damaged . moreover , the mob exhumed the body of devi and burned it , as part of a hindu ritual , baca reported . devi ' s uncle , joginder singh , told Ucanews that they were not aware devi ' s husband was a christian and that they found out about it last month " when she told us over the phone that her husband took her to christmas prayers at a church in punjab . he must have coerced her to convert to christianity . " kumar was severely beaten and arrested , along with seven other christians , by local police . none of the hindus involved in the mob violence were arrested . william masih , a local christian , told baca that during the violence , local police just stood by and watched and that christians , who are already marginalized , have become more fearful . state lawmaker sheikh abdul rasheed has called for the arrest of the people who burned down christian property , and decried the persecution of minorities across the country . according to baca , the pastor of the church that was burned down has gone into hiding and christians from that church are being forcibly reconverted back to hinduism . wilson chowdhry , chairman of the british asian christian association , said in a statement , " this attack on innocent christians highlights the increasing hatred towards non - hindus in an india that has become increasingly polarized under the narendra modi regime . " attacks on christians are increasing with intensity and frequency and rarely result in convictions for the perpetrators . " while few incidents of christian persecution are reported from the state of jammu and kashmir , the incidence of attacks on christians is alarmingly high in several other parts of the country . false allegations on christians are also common across the country . christian persecution has steeply risen since the hindu rightwing bharatiya janata party won the general election in 2014 . the first quarter of 2017 saw 248 incidents of persecution , and by the end of june , the number grew to 410 , compared to a total of 441 incidents reported in all of 2016 , a recent report by open doors revealed . " when the christians are beaten by the extremists , they receive injuries mostly on their heads or their vital body parts , " a local partner of open doors said in the report . " the assaulters do not care if the person dies in the attack . they know that they will not be punished because the government ( and hence the judiciary ) will take their side . in most of the cases the assaulters go unpunished . " the governing party in india is connected with a hindu nationalist organization , rashtriya swayamsevak sangh , whose founder , m . s . golwalkar , has said : " the non - hindu people in hindustan ( referring to india ) must either adopt the hindu culture and language , must learn to respect and revere hindu religion , must entertain no idea but the glorification of the hindu religion , that is they must not only give up their attitude of intolerance and ingratitude toward this land and its age - long tradition but must also cultivate the positive attitude of love and devotion instead ; in one word they must cease to be foreigners or may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the hindu nation claiming nothing , deserving no privileges , far less any preferential treatment not even citizen ' s rights .

( photo : rocket republic , courtesy of erlc ) richard stearns , president of world vision , addresses the evangelicals for life conference at jw marriott in washington , d . c . on january 19 , 2018 . washiNgtON the president of a christian humanitarian relief organizations is urging christians embrace a pro - life ethic that includes refugees , the elderly , and immigrants in addition to the unborn . and followers of jesus must be especially watchful that american national identity does not trump their identity in christ , he says . at evangelicals for life 2018 held at the jw marriott hotel last week , world vision president richard stearns sat down with the christian post for an interview about the importance of valuing life at every stage , a recurring theme throughout the two - day conference that coincided with the march for life , the largest annual pro - life gathering in the nation . " some of the same people that value the unborn as precious lives don ' t want refugees to seek asylum in our country or may want to build a wall to keep out immigrants that might come across illegally , " stearns lamented . people tend to put different price tags on different lives and all of us tend to look at the world with our own filters and lenses and values systems , he continued . and although the phrase " consistently pro - life " has become clich " you can ' t just value the unborn , you have to value the elderly , you have to value the immigrant , you have to value the disabled , you have to value people you don ' t agree with , people of other religions , " he said . " the most powerful witness christians have for the truth of the gospel is unconditional love , especially for the least of these , the widow , the orphan , the stranger . " when christians love the unlovable unconditionally and sacrificially , " the world steps back and takes notice and says ' wow , who are these people how do we explain their unconditional love they are doing things that we would never expect them to do and they value life . ' " stearns further expressed concern the current political climate , urging christians to resist the temptation to pledge unquestioning allegiance to a particular party or movement . " here ' s what i think is happening in our culture , our identity as americans , our national identity , is trumping our religious identity , " he said . " but our identity in christ should be at the very , very top of our value system and it should inform everything else . " " god does not put a price tag on americans and say they are worth more than syrians . we ' re the ones that are doing that . we are the ones that are playing with the price tags . and i think we have mixed up our national identity and our politics with our faith to a point where some can no longer tell the difference between all of those domains in their life . " the world vision president noted that lately he has taken to saying that far too often people , whether their views lean to the right or left , spend too much time considering what is politically correct when they ought to be concerned about being biblically correct . " if we ' re biblically correct about refugees we would see god loves those refugees . these are people in desperate situations , that have lost loved ones , have fled their homes , that have nothing . these are the people jesus talked about when he spoke ' for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , " stearns said , citing matthew 25 : 35 . " we should have no other response but to say , ' how can we help these people ' " while it is important for christians to be politically engaged , whenever the church gets consumed with politics it sullies the church , not the politicians , stearns said . earlier this month it was announced that stearns will be retiring , having been the longest serving leader at world vision in the organization ' s history . cp asked him what he is most proud of and heartened by during his tenure . " most of our constituents , our child sponsors , are surprised to hear that in the last 25 years more people have been lifted out of extreme poverty than at any time in history , " he recounted . an estimated 2 . 8 billion lacked access to clean water in 1990 and today it ' s less than 700 million , he noted . likewise , maternal mortality in childbirth has been halved , world hunger has been reduced , adult literacy has climbed substantially . " the world is changing in profound ways for the better and almost every indicator of poverty is going in the right direction . " and these encouraging developments in the past few decades are bigger than putting a man on the moon and ought to be celebrated much more , he said .
( screenshot : youtube / alliance defending freedom ) carl and angel larsen , the couple who owns the minnesota - based telescope media group . in dec . 2016 , the larsens filed suit against a state law that would compel them to film same - sex wedding ceremonies despite their religious objections . a christian couple who were told by minnesota officials that they must film same - sex weddings despite their religious objections have appealed to the eighth circuit court of appeals . carl and angel larsen of telescope media group appealed a lower court decision from last year which said they had to film same - sex weddings or face legal penalties . alliance defending freedom , a conservative law firm representing the larsens , filed an opening brief last friday arguing that minnesota law violates the couple ' s constitutional rights . " the larsens serve all people . they just cannot convey all messages . because of their religious beliefs , they cannot celebrate any vision of marriage other than one between one man and one woman , " read the brief . expand collapse " at the same time , the larsens ' faith requires them to use their talents to express messages that honor god . they want to do this by producing wedding films , publishing them online , and posting a statement explaining their religious views . but these plans are on hold because minnesota will punish them if they post their statement or create wedding films consistent with their faith while declining to create wedding films promoting contrary views . " adf senior counsel jeremy tedesco said in a statement released monday that the state " shouldn ' t threaten artists with fines and jail simply for living in accordance with their beliefs in the artistic marketplace . " " americans should have the freedom to disagree on significant matters of conscience , which is why everyone , regardless of their view of marriage , should support the larsens , " added tedesco . " government is supposed to be freedom ' s greatest protector , not its greatest threat . that ' s why we are asking the 8 th circuit to reverse the district court ' s decision . " in december 2016 , the larsens filed suit against the minnesota human rights act ' s ban on sexual orientation discrimination , stating that the measure would force them to film same - sex weddings . u . s . district court judge john tunheim ruled against the larsens last september , arguing , among other things , that the law is " neutral " in its application and does not force businesses to convey a government message . judge tunheim also concluded that while the law " does incidentally require wedding videographers to make videos they might not want to make , " these concerns are " immaterial . " " first , speech - for - hire is commonly understood to reflect the views of the customer , " wrote tunheim . " thus , when a person views a wedding video , there is little danger that they would naturally attribute the video ' s messages to the videographer . " " second , the larsens can easily disclaim personal sponsorship of the messages depicted in the wedding videos they create for clients . for example , the larsens could post language on their website stating that while they follow applicable law , and thus serve couples regardless of protected status , they are opposed to same - sex marriage .

( photo : facebook ) robert and cindy litzinger . a mother of two has filed a lawsuit against former church for life pastor robert litzinger and his wife cindy , alleging sexual battery , assault and harassment stemming from a slew of incidents , including teaching young women how to masturbate and orgasm in preparation for their husbands in pre - marriage classes . robert litzinger , explains the santa maria times , stepped down from the helm of the california church in june 2016 after complaints were made to church personnel about opinions he allegedly shared on viewing pornography in one of his pre - marital classes . the lawsuit filed by a jane doe in her 30 s alleges that litzinger ' s wife , cindy , knowingly co - conspired in the misconduct from 2014 - 16 . shortly after litzinger stepped down , the mother learned that she was not the only victim of the unwanted advances and more than a dozen women had similar stories to share . doe charged in the lawsuit that litzinger exploited his position as lead pastor to " cultivate an atmosphere within church for life , through which he could satisfy his sexual fetishes . " in pre - marital classes , she alleged that the pastor would try and " prepare the young women for their husbands and their wedding night , " advising the women on how to masturbate , have an orgasm and explore their bodies , in order to be " prepared and willing to do whatever their husbands wanted . " he would also share photos with doe of himself and cindy , covered in bed , with a note saying " just had a great session " and urged her to be similarly open with him about her sex life . he reportedly badgered her until she complied with his request . litzinger and his wife appear very open about their love for each other in a video posted to youtube . " my wife , my lover and we get to sleep together and all that kind of stuff , " the ex - pastor says as he introduces his wife at a church event . " thanks babe , " cindy replies in the video as robert kisses her before the congregation . " i love you . i love you , " she says as he walks off stage . " we slept great together last night too , just in case you were wondering , " she then tells the church . " we did great , we actually slept . " the lawsuit claims cindy facilitated her husband ' s sexual conduct and the church allegedly took no action against them prior to their departure in 2016 . doe charged that she was invited to a prayer group at the couple ' s home once and the pastor groped her breasts and genitals . when she complained to cindy , the groping was dismissed as an " innocent mistake . " cindy ' s attorneys denied allegations that she aided and abetted robert ' s alleged sexual conduct and insisted doe ' s allegation of groping was " an innocent mistake . " doe said when she eventually complained to other pastors at the church but " those complaints fell on deaf ears , " the lawsuit said , and she was directed to speak with litzinger about her concerns directly .

" i ' m afraid i have to stop recommending samaritan ' s purse . the judgment of its leadership raises too many questions , " wrote radio host and editor of resurgent erick erickson , on twitter , responding to graham ' s recent interview with msnbc . graham is the president and ceo of samaritan ' s purse as well as the billy graham evangelistic association . " does the president have a sin problem " msnbc " live " anchor alex witt asked graham , referring to the alleged affair with porn star stormy daniels . " he is not president perfect , " graham told witt . " president trump i don ' t think has admitted to having an affair with this person . and so this is just a news story , and i don ' t even know if it ' s accurate . " graham added that he believes " at 70 years of age , the president is a much different person today than he was four years ago , five years ago , 10 years ago , or whatever and we just have to give the man the benefit of the doubt . " peter wehner , a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center think tank , wrote : " watching franklin graham do all he can to yet again shield trump from criticism , after having done the same thing on behalf of roy moore , is painful , discouraging and corrosive to the christian witness . the best you can say is he ' s blind to the damage . " moore , an unsuccessful alabama senate candidate , was also recently accused of sexual misconduct . the rev . dr . william barber , an author and president and senior lecturer of repairers of the breach , tweeted , " brother franklin_graham , we do have a sin problem . our politicians are like ravenous wolves . and preachers like you are covering for them . " o . alan noble , managing editor and co - founder of christ and pop culture and an assistant professor of english at oklahoma baptist university , said it is often claimed that evangelical " elites " opposed trump while lay evangelicals backed him . " but this depends entirely on how you define ' elite . ' virtually every single major evangelical figure in the national political space backed trump , like graham , " he wrote . journalist and columnist roland martin tweeted , " want to see why white conservative evangelicals have sold their soul to realdonaldtrump , just listen to franklin_graham . my man frank_schaeffer has been exposing these sometimey christians for a long time . " earlier this month , the wall street journal reported that a lawyer for trump had paid 130 , 000 in hush money to stormy daniels . daniels , whose given name is stephanie clifford , has claimed to multiple publications that she had sex with trump around the time that his wife melania had given birth to their son , barron . according to the story , daniels and trump began their affair in july 2006 at the american century celebrity golf tournament in which trump invited the porn star into his hotel room and they had what she later described as " textbook generic " sex . on msnbc , graham was also asked about his support for a president who was recently accused of referring to haiti , el salvador and african nations as " s * * * hole countries . " graham said he doesn ' t think it ' s hypocritical . " he said he didn ' t say it , so i have to go along with the president in that he didn ' t say it , " graham said . " why are we having all these people from s * * * hole countries come here " trump allegedly asked during a recent meeting at the oval office in the white house with several republicans and democrats during immigration negotiations , according to the washington post , which also reported that the president said he would prefer people from countries like norway to come to america instead .

fox news personality todd starnes attributed donald trump s election to divine intervention aided by prayer rallies led by evangelist franklin graham in an american pastor s network radio interview feb . 9 . starnes , a fox news personality for more than a decade who early in his career wrote for the southern baptist convention news service baptist press , said that he interviewed the head of both the billy graham evangelistic association and samaritan s purse for his new book the deplorables guide to making america great again on thursday s installment of stand in the gap today . he told me we were at a moral tipping point , and i m not sure if people understand what was literally at stake and how close we were to losing the country , to losing the culture , if hillary clinton had won , said starnes , whose previous books include god less america published in 2014 . losing the supreme court , not just for an election cycle but for generations , that s how much was at stake here . starnes said he believes graham s message resonated with christians across the country as the evangelist shared it with an estimated 230 , 000 people during his decision america tour urging voters to pray , vote and engage in the political process during the summer and fall . i would not discount the power of what franklin graham did , said starnes , recognized by pollster george barna as one of the top 10 media influencers for conservative evangelicals in the 2016 presidential election . he did not endorse , but what he did do in 2016 was stage massive prayer gatherings at every single state capital in the country , starnes said . i believe that we experienced divine intervention last november . i believe that god was giving us a second chance . we ve been given a second chance , and christians , we ve got to stand up and we ve got to get it right . graham , son of 98 - year - old retired evangelist billy graham , said in december he didn t believe it was the russians who intervened in trump s election but god . i don t have any scientific information , graham reportedly told a crowd at trump s final thank you rally in mobile , ala . i don t have a stack of emails to read to you , but i have an opinion : i believe it was god . god showed up . he answered the prayers of hundreds of thousands of people across this land who had been praying for this country . graham recently came under criticism for defending president trump s executive order barring citizens of seven muslim - majority countries from entering the united states for 90 days and suspending the admission of all refugees for 120 days subsequently blocked by federal courts . the baptist churches of puerto rico responded by withdrawing endorsement for graham s feb . 10 - 12 festival of hope evangelistic rally in san juan , terming the preacher s endorsement of trump s anti - immigration stance contrary to the values of the kingdom . graham continued to defend the trump travel ban on social media , posting feb . 11 on facebook that as head of a humanitarian organization working in more than 100 countries , including most on the banned list , i feel i have something to say about this issue . we are working to help thousands of refugees every day in different countries , graham described the work of samaritan s purse . like the good samaritan jesus told about in the bible , we help those who have been hurt along life s road . but that doesn t mean we don t need to make the borders of our own country secure . we shouldn t be na ve , graham said . just because we give medical care to isis fighters doesn t mean i would want to allow any one of them to immigrate to the united states . that would be crazy . graham said taking time to vet who is being allowed to enter america isn t too much to ask . we need to know who they are , he said . god does tell us to help the stranger and those in need ; but god doesn t tell us to expose our cities , homes and lives to hostile people . starnes began his journalistic career in newspapers . in 2000 he landed a job as staff writer for baptist press and later moved to assistant editor . baptist press fired him in 2003 after he interviewed secretary of education rod paige and quoted him as saying he personally preferred private christian education over public schools . after a controversy that nearly cost the secretary his job , paige claimed that starnes quoted him out of context . seven years later his former employer welcomed starnes back as keynote speaker at the 2010 baptist press collegiate journalism conference . after leaving baptist press starnes turned briefly to public relations as director of university communications at baptist - affiliated union university in jackson , tenn . he switched to radio , moving to california before eventually landing in new york as overnight anchor for fox news radio . today starnes is heard daily on hundreds of radio stations around the nation . he writes a column , hosts a digital show for foxnews . com and appears regularly on fox news channel and fox business network . starnes describes himself as a gun toting , chicken eating son of a baptist with a penchant for finding stories about conservative christians who feel discriminated against in america s culture wars . critics attribute his appeal to fox s key demographic of older , white christian conservatives to his use of over - the - top rhetoric and indifference toward checking the facts in his stories . previous stories : baptists withdraw support for franklin graham rally in puerto rico franklin graham says god uses extreme vetting , welcomes confirmation of attorney general
canadian baptists joined other christian leaders in an open letter criticizing evangelist franklin graham s upcoming visit to vancouver , british columbia , released feb . 24 . clergy from churches representing more than 60 percent of the christians in the metro area said they fear contentious and confrontational political and social rhetoric used by graham to criticize muslims and lgbt persons and defend donald trump has the potential to overshadow the message of jesus and incite hostility in our highly charged social climate . the letter comes in the aftermath of a mass shooting at a mosque in quebec that killed six and wounded 19 on jan . 29 , two days after president trump s executive order barring travelers from seven muslim majority countries from entering the united states . regrettably , franklin graham s public comments appear to compromise jesus s mission of love and justice for all , the letter said . he has made disparaging and uncharitable remarks about muslims and the lgbtq + community , while portraying the election , administration and policies of u . s . president donald trump as intrinsically aligned with the christian church . church leaders said examples incendiary speech by graham compiled in a separate document do not convey the spirit of christ that we would hope to see preached by an ambassador of the gospel to canada . among other things , graham is quoted as saying all muslims should be banned from the u . s . , islam is a very evil and wicked religion and the outcome of the recent presidential election was due to the hand of god , the letter said , giving the impression that the christian church as an institution is partisanly aligned with an administration and its policies . signers of the letter included laura nelson , president of the board of canadian baptists of western canada and pastor of olivet baptist church , and jeremy bell , executive minister of the organization of 183 baptist churches in four western provinces , the yukon and the northwest territories . the canadian baptists of western canada is affiliated with the baptist world alliance and north american baptist fellowship . two of the letter signers identify as cbwc pastors . one of them , pastor tim dickau of grandview calvary baptist church , signed a previous open letter last summer criticizing graham as a polarizing figure whose ungracious and bigoted remarks have the potential to generate serious negative impact on the christian witness in vancouver . the religious leaders said they worked behind the scenes for nine months hoping to persuade the planning committee for the march 3 - 5 festival of hope to find a more suitable speaker . they intended to release their letter feb . 21 but agreed to postpone it to give graham time to reply in writing . they said graham responded feb . 23 , promising to avoid controversial statements while in vancouver but not retracting harmful comments made in the past . they encouraged graham to also release his reply to the public . the faith leaders said they bear no ill will toward the festival of hope committee but simply believe it is a mistake to think franklin graham s political stances are immaterial to his presenting the gospel . earlier this month leaders in the baptist churches of puerto rico withdrew their support for graham s feb . 10 - 12 festival of hope evangelistic rally in san juan , terming graham s endorsement of trump s immigration policies contrary to the values of the kingdom . graham shows no sign of toning down his political views . on feb . 27 he commented on facebook about a news story on george w . bush s daughter barbara planning to speak at a fundraiser for planned parenthood . planned parenthood is the 1 abortion provider in the united states , graham said . raising funds for this organization is like raising money to fund a nazi death camp like auschwitz , except for innocent babies in their mother s wombs reports say they perform over 300 , 000 abortions per year . and this is the organization whose employees were caught on video trying to sell baby body parts over wine . disgusting . previous stories : pastors oppose franklin graham crusade in canada baptists withdraw support for franklin graham rally in puerto rico
baptists in puerto rico have withdrawn support for franklin graham s feb . 10 - 12 festival of hope evangelistic rally in san juan in protest of the evangelist s endorsement of anti - immigration policies espoused by president donald trump . the executive minister and the president of the baptist churches of puerto rico issued a statement feb . 4 saying graham s endorsement of trump s policies are for us contrary to the values of the kingdom . the baptist churches of puerto rico historically affirms that our standard of faith and conduct is the bible , executive minister roberto dieppa - b ez and president margarita ramirez said in the statement written in spanish . from the old testament to the new testament , god continually calls us to justice , to love , peace and mercy and , above all , to accompany the marginalized , foreigners , widows and orphans , they said according to an internet translation . the baptist leaders said trump s immigration policies attack the life of our neighbor , and jesus has always called us to love even enemies and to be our brother s keeper . the release said the baptist churches of puerto rico board of directors decided to withdraw their support for the event being held at the same stadium where graham s father , billy graham , preached to more than 175 , 000 people during the san juan global mission in 1995 for reasons of conscience . the baptist leaders said individual churches and pastors remain free to make up their own mind about whether to participate . franklin graham , who succeeded his father as ceo of the billy graham evangelistic association in 2002 , recently defended trump s executive order blocking refugees from syria from entering the country and barring immigrants from seven predominantly muslim nations deemed high risk by the white house , saying for him it is not a bible issue . it s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come , that s not a bible issue , graham said in a huffington post article published jan . 25 . we want to love people , we want to be kind to people , we want to be considerate , but we have a country and a country should have order and there are laws that relate to immigration and i think we should follow those laws , graham told associate religion editor carol kuruvilla . because of the dangers we see today in this world , we need to be very careful . the baptist churches of puerto rico is one of 34 regions affiliated with american baptist churches usa and the only one that is fully hispanic . as of 2011 the region numbered 112 churches with more than 25 , 000 members . the region s leaders said they do not intend to undermine the festival of hope but issued their statement in order to affirm our testimony in favor of the poor , marginalized and foreigners , among others . let us continue in prayer so that the gospel of jesus can be proclaimed and lived in all our earth , the baptist leaders said . it isn t the first time that graham s outspoken views on controversial issues such as homosexuality , islam and immigration have caused a stumbling block for an evangelistic event . last fall five pastors in canada two of them baptists said publicly they would not be supporting graham s march 2017 festival of hope crusade in vancouver , labeling him a poor witness for the gospel . in addition to his role with the billy graham evangelistic association , graham runs samaritan s purse , an international relief agency with programs including operation christmas child , an annual event that recruits volunteers in churches and other organizations to fill shoeboxes with christmas gifts for impoverished children in more than 150 countries and territories around the world . a baptist news global columnist recently suggested moderate baptist churches that participate in operation christmas child unwittingly give graham a platform to spout his political views . do you really want to send a dose of hatred along with that shoebox of christmas trinkets mark wingfield , associate pastor of wilshire baptist church in dallas , wrote jan . 28 . does handing out christmas gifts counterbalance graham s declaration that many of those who receive them would not be welcome in america there are other and better ways to support refugees and children in need around the world , said wingfield , a member of the baptist news global board of directors . in reality , sending a shoebox of odds and ends is less effective than providing food and clothing and shelter and education . if you are outraged by franklin graham s misrepresentation of christian doctrine , channel your support somewhere else , like world vision or any of the reputable denomination - based relief agencies , wingfield said . the charlotte observer reported in 2015 that between his two jobs graham received compensation totaling more than 880 , 000 in 2013 . that made him the highest - paid ceo of any international relief agency based in the united states , but it was less than the 1 . 2 million he received in 2008 . last year the irs reclassified the billy graham evangelistic association as an association of churches so that the charity is no longer required to file a financial disclosure form that includes top salaries of executives . the sister organization samaritan s purse also requested reclassification for the same reasons but reportedly did not receive an immediate response . previous stories : pastors oppose franklin graham crusade in canada bwa criticizes muslim travel ban

it has become fairly clear by this point that donald trump stirs controversy everywhere he goes , as his offensive rhetoric and illogical behaviour have become major points of contention . protests against various trump policies have become prevalent throughout the country , as ordinary citizens and advocates band together to protest and voice their opinions against his divisive agenda . whether this was the recent women s march on the anniversary of trump s inauguration , or the activism of those with haitian backgrounds in taking to the streets of new york after the president referred to the country as a sh * thole , people everywhere are taking a stand . such is the case now , in switzerland , as citizens of davos have taken to the streets to protest their distaste for the insensitive president . earlier this month , it was announced that trump would attend the world economic forum in davos , a global meeting who s cooperative and globalist initiatives seemingly run contrary to the america first agenda the president has promoted . concerns have arisen surrounding the president s speech at the forum , and the likelihood that he will use the global stage to stir further disdain amongst america s global allies . swiss marchers protest against trump , break through davos security cordon < URL > nightengalejml2 ( 54 nightengale ) january 23 , 2018 earlier this week , however , trump s davos trip seemed to be in doubt , due to the ongoing government shutdown that arose . with the complications having entered their third day , it seemed as if the president would be unable to attend the summit of economic elites , as democrats and republicans remained at odds in finding an agreement that was suitable for both sides . the primary issue in causing the shutdown revolved around immigration policies and threats to daca recipients , as the trump administration has attempted to dissolve the program which protects those who entered the country illegally as minors , often with their families , and stayed in the country illegally , from being deported . however , the shutdown ended on the third day , as democrats received commitments from gOp lawmakers that daca recipients would be protected . trump , now on his way to the forum in switzerland , will not be traveling alone , as he takes along with him quite a large entourage . according to a report by pOliticO , in addition to trump , the large davos delegation [ is ] set to include chief of staff john kelly , national security adviser h . r . mcmaster , national economic council director gary cohn and other senior staff as well as several other cabinet secretaries and jared kushner , trump s son - in - law . as trump embarked on his trip , swiss citizens were quick to mobilize against the president s arrival . nearly 2 , 000 protesters organized to tell trump that he was not welcome . protesters claimed that they were advocating against trump s racial insensitivity , sexism and disregard for women s rights , and his apparent carelessness regarding climate change , as was seen in his decision to pull the united states out of the paris climate accords earlier last year . earlier today , it was revealed that first lady melania trump had backed out from attending the trip with her husband , as allegations surrounding his affair with stormy daniels , an adult movie actress , emerged earlier this month . the president is reported to have had a sexual relationship with the actress 18 months after his marriage to melania , and just 4 months after the birth of their child , barron . since then , melania trump has maintained a low profile , with opting out of the davos trip being a major example of tensions between the two . in addition to the massive protests against trump in the city of davos itself , it became evident that the activism spread to other areas of switzerland as well . protesters also gathered in the major cities of zurich s financial district , with slogans related to his anti - environmental policies . featured image by getty images

bees are in danger and it is a very serious issue . bees are responsible for pollinating the majority of the plants on our planet , without bees who will do the pollination bee populations have been declining since the early 2000 s and began in far fewer numbers than we are seeing now . agricultural records from more than a century ago do note the occasional bee disappearance but it was nothing like what we are currently dealing with . colony collapse disorder ccd is something identified around 2014 , this infectious disease was ravaging the us as well as european honeybee hives . now , ccd is not considered a problem in the same ways it was back in 2014 the bee population is still declining . our planet is constantly becoming more and more polluted and with the industrial use of herbicides and insecticides , bees do not stand much of a chance . honeybees both wild and domestic makeup about 80 percent of all pollination in the world to be more exact . one single bee can pollinate around 300 million flowers each day . fruits and veggies are pollinated by bees . without the bees , we would be in big trouble . while chemical industries consider the bee collapse to be a mystery . the cause is clear and apparent . bees are dying from the use of pesticides , drought , nutrition deficit , air pollution , global warming , and so many other factors . we are responsible for the death of the bees , we are KiLLing the bees . greenpeace reported as follows on the issue : biologists have found more than 150 different chemical residues in bee pollen , a deadly pesticide cocktail according to university of california apiculturist eric mussen . the chemical companies bayer , syngenta , basf , dow , dupont , and monsanto shrug their shoulders at the systemic complexity as if the mystery were too complicated . they advocate no change in pesticide policy . after all , selling poisons to the world s farmers is profitable . furthermore , wild bee habitat shrinks every year as industrial agribusiness converts grasslands and forest into monoculture farms , which are then contaminated with pesticides . to reverse the world bee decline , we need to fix our dysfunctional and destructive agricultural system . common sense actions can restore and protect the world s bees . here s a strong start : ban the seven most dangerous pesticides . protect pollinator health by preserving wild habitat . restore ecological agriculture . ecological farming is the overarching new policy trend that will stabilize human food production , preserve wild habitats , and protect the bees . the nation of bhutan has led the world in adopting a 100 percent organic farming policy . mexico has banned genetically modified corn to protect its native corn varieties . eight european countries have banned genetically modified crops and hungary has burned more than 1 , 000 acres of corn contaminated with genetically modified varieties . in india , scientist vandana shiva and a network of small farmers have built an organic farming resistance to industrial agriculture over two decades . ecological , organic farming is nothing new . it is the way most farming has been done throughout human history . ecological farming resists insect damage by avoiding large monocrops and preserving ecosystem diversity . ecological farming restores soil nutrients with natural composting systems , avoids soil loss from wind and water erosion , and avoids pesticides and chemical fertilizers . by restoring bee populations and healthier bees , ecological agriculture improves pollination , which in turn improves crop yields . ecological farming takes advantage of the natural ecosystem services , water filtration , pollination , oxygen production , and disease and pest control . organic farmers have advocated better research and funding by industry , government , farmers , and the public to develop organic farming techniques , improve food production , and maintain ecological health . the revolution in farming would promote equitable diets around the world and support crops primarily for human consumption , avoiding crops for animal food and biofuels . why is it that we are not making the necessary efforts here in the us to protect the bees is this issue not imminent enough

when we lose a loved one we may struggle with the grief and sense of loss . it s difficult to say goodbye , the idea of never seeing this person again is both frightening and upsetting . while some may not believe in the concept of an afterlife of a spiritual realm , for those that do there is the hope that we will one day hear from those that have left us . while our loved ones can t return to us in the physical form that we remember , there are a number of different ways that they may try to communicate with us . from signs and symbols to shifts in energy , these little signs are sometimes missed or overlooked , however , if we are aware of what we are looking for we can keep our eyes open to these messages . here are 11 signs that a deceased loved one is trying to contact you : 1 music have you ever noticed that you keep hearing a specific song over and over again it s playing when you turn on the radio , on the pa system at your local mall and appearing in movies , television shows , and commercials . if this song has some sort of meaning to you or reminds you of your deceased loved one in some way , it may not be a coincidence . music is often used as an effective means of communication both when we are alive and after we pass . 2 familiar scents have you ever been walking through the house only to be met with a familiar scent , one that immediately reminds you of a loved one maybe it s your grandmother s favorite perfume or the smell of your uncle s pipe . it is said that the sense of smell is the most ancient of the senses , so if a loved one is near we may not be able to see them or touch them , but our sense of smell is strong enough that we may still pick it up . know that you aren t losing your mind , this is a sign that your loved one is close . 3 objects moving / shifting one way that spirits will try to communicate us is by moving everyday objects . they may crack open a door , move an item into your path in order to catch your attention , or they may move a specific item . if the item has meaning , this may reveal who is trying to make contact with you or the message that they are trying to share . in many cases , they are simply trying to let you know that they are around . 4 clocks stop if you notice that the clocks in your home stop or temporarily freeze with no real explanation , this may be a sign that a loved one is trying to use these devices to communicate with you . the message differs from case to case , with some reporting that the clock stops at the time of death of their loved one , while others say the time was symbolic in some way . for example , it may stop at 7 : 15 if july 15 th is a birthdate , anniversary or important date of some type . 5 they appear in your dreams when you are in a dream state , your senses and spiritual connections are heightened , making it easier than ever for your loved ones to reach out and interact with you . you may see the form of your loved one , interacting with them directly in your dream , or they may send you a sign or symbol , something that is recognizable to you . there are even times that these dreams appear so real that it is hard to draw the line between dream and reality . 6 sensing their presence the hardest of the signs to quantify , many people report that they can sense when a family member is around . you may simply feel as though there is someone nearby in the room , or you get the sense that someone is watching you . those that are able to recognize that it is a loved one nearby often report feeling comforted by the presence , a familiar feeling that they associate with when their loved one was alive . 7 butterflies and dragonflies those who study spirituality understand that there are a number of common signs and omens , each carrying their own message . butterflies and dragonflies are often associated with the spirit world , meaning that they appear when someone from that world is attempting to communicate with the living . 8 light bulbs and candles flickering those who return to visit us from the spiritual realm bring with them a significant amount of energy . light is known for being one of the purest forms of energy , and as such , it is easily influenced by outside energy sources . when your loved one moves near a light bulb or a candle , this causes the light to flicker . 9 black feathers there is a legend that dates back generations that if you find a single black feather it is a sign from the universe that a loved one is attempting to make contact with you . the full legend states that feathers can carry a number of different messages , revealed by the color . black specifically pertains to the spirit of an ancestor . 10 electronic devices act up similar to the phenomenon that we see when our loved ones move near a light source , the energy that a spirit contains can also influence the electronic devices that we use on a daily basis . you may notice that your television screen mysteriously goes fuzzy , your radio changes stations or your laptop turns off without warning . if there is no physical reason for your electronics to be on the fritz , this is likely a sign that someone is nearby . 11 sudden change in temperature a well - known sign of a spiritual presence , if you feel an unexplained breeze , or a sudden drop in temperature this may be the sign that the spirit of a loved one is near . there are many explanations for this , depending on who you speak to . some say that spirits draw energy in order to try to contact us , and pulling this energy pulls the heat from the room . others say that we experience a sudden chill when a spirit attempts to touch us or make contact . the one common fact that unites all explanations is that these changes in temperature indicate a spirit is near .
children are not toys . while some of us may feel like they belong to us , we all need to understand that they are people as well . when our children throw a fit , of course , they should be dealt with . they shouldn t be allowed to run all over everyone . discipline is necessary regardless of how you do it ( within reason no , abusing your children is not okay ) . but , when we are listening to our children cry because they are in trouble and we just stand there ignoring them we are sending them the wROnG message . i know a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this one but please understand where i am coming from . affection is not a reward . comfort is not a reward . love is not a reward . we should not never just ignore our children . we should comfort them when they are upset . sure , they should know that something they have done is wrong but we shouldn t set them up to think that just because we are angry that they no longer deserve our love and affection . children are people , i cannot stress this enough . their mental well - being is iMPORtant . think back to a point in your childhood where you were upset and crying with no one to comfort you , how did that make you feel didn t feel good , did it your children need to know that their feelings dO matter . i see parents doing this all the time , they think that by doing this they are going to be able to make their children more obedient and i think that is bullshit . ignoring our children when they really feel like there is something wrong ; when they are so upset that their bodies will not let them stop crying it digs a hole between the two of you . this overtime shows your children that when there is something truly wrong they shouldn t come to you . it shows them on some level that you won t be there to help them through the tough points in their lives . it weakens the connection you have with your children . no , i don t mean we should turn our children into snowflakes but we should be there for them in all ways possible even when they are in trouble . they can be disciplined and still not feel neglected emotionally at the same time . you can tell your child no and still comfort him or her . you don t have to give in and buy that toy , you can just be there for them and that is enough . comforting your child gives him or her a sense of trust in you that you will not be able to win back if you don t nurture it now . be there for your children in all the ways that you can .
the concept of health , wellness , and modern medicine has largely revolved around our physical body . we invest our time , energy and funding into better understanding the individual systems of the body such as the circulatory system , or the human brain , seeking a comprehensive understanding of how they work , the way in which they interact with one another and what steps we can take to prevent and treat any ailments or illnesses . recently , however , many experts in the medical profession have begun to open their eyes to a bigger understanding of the whole , seriously considering the impact that other areas of our lives , such as our emotional or spiritual health , can have on our overall health . the concept is built on the belief of the four spectrums of health , including spiritual , mental , emotional and physical health . these spectrums aren t individual and isolated concepts , but rather deeply connected with one another creating a complicated web known as our overall health . when one of these areas begins to falter or fall out of balance , the rest are , in turn , impacted . a clear example is the impact of depression on the human body . while it is largely associated with negative or extreme feelings of sadness , there are also physical symptoms reported by suffers including aches and pains , changes in appetite and chronic fatigue . while depression is considered a mental illness , it is felt in our physical health as well . holistic healing works to focus on this balance , working to bring all spectrums of health back into alignment . doing so will allow every organ , process , and system in our bodies to function at their optimal state of functioning , which is the point we define as being healthy . this point in our lives is one of harmony , in which everything works as intended . the process of rebalancing your whole being in this way is known as healing . while very few people subscribe solely to alternative medicine practices , still visiting their doctor to discuss their medical concerns , it is estimated that approximately one - third of americans will seek help in some form outside of their doctor s office as part of their overall healing efforts . this reflects an important shift in our society today , one in which the population , including the medical community , are opening our eyes to the benefits of incorporating holistic healing with our current medical practices . as we begin to embrace these healing practices , including but not limited to meditation , herbology , aromatherapy and chakra balancing , we are encouraging scientists and researchers to put more of their time and efforts into better understanding the effectiveness of these treatments . for example , melatonin has become a widely accepted natural treatment for those that are suffering from issues with their sleep cycle . as word spreads about its effectiveness , the number of adults using melatonin doubled between 2007 and 2012 . today it is recognized as a great way of addressing complications associated with jet lag , and offering relief for children , adults and the elderly who struggle with falling asleep . while there are some studies confirming this effectiveness , researchers continue to explore the beneficial use of melatonin for the average american . as we continue to embrace alternative treatment practices , we will likely see an increase in cooperation between our family doctors and medical practitioners and those who practice alternative treatments . this isn t to say that there is no place in the future for modern medicine , but that our best overall health will be accomplished through considering all areas of our lives . it s only a matter of time before we see our family doctors prescribing chakra balancing during a routine physical exam

franklin graham is dead wrong about immigration , refugees and the bible . and his comments will have deadly consequences . and by the way , if you support samaritan s purse and its operation christmas child next december , you will be supporting graham s kind of twisted christian witness . more on that in a moment . on top of previous outlandish comments about muslims , the son of america s most famous evangelist last week rushed to the defense of donald trump , saying the president s hardline ban on immigration was just fine because it is not a biblical issue . file this under the category of alternative facts . although let s give the younger graham a little slack because on one point he s right : the bible does not discuss american immigration policy . in the old testament , we read about the nation of israel , and america is not israel . but here s what god does say in deuteronomy 10 , when the children of israel have just escaped bondage in egypt : for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords , the great god , mighty and awesome , who is not partial and takes no bribe , who executes justice for the orphan and the widow , and who loves the strangers , providing them food and clothing . you shall also love the stranger , for you were strangers in the land of egypt . that s one of 92 times the hebrew word we would translate to immigrant in english appears in the old testament . and in every case , the admonition is for acceptance and welcome and kindness . the new testament doesn t conceive of a political nation , but jesus directives are given toward individuals who are to act in christ - like ways wherever they live . so , for example , in matthew 25 we hear these words of jesus about the kind of behavior god rewards : i was a stranger and you welcomed me . so , yes , the bible does not give directions on american foreign policy , even though too many evangelical christians act like it does . american foreign policy is not , strictly speaking , a biblical issue . but how a nation full of christians and a government filled with professing christians should treat immigrants is indeed a biblical issue . and there s no equivocation that the biblical mandate is for welcome , not building walls , not closing borders , not seeking our own welfare to the detriment of strangers in dire need . you cannot make a biblical case for the policies enacted by donald trump and tacitly approved by congress silence . as a result of this policy , people will die . immigrants who need to flee horrendous situations will be trapped and will die . and then others will die because america s protectionism will breed more terrorism and more hatred . how in god s name is any of that biblical franklin graham has a voice not only because he is his father s son but because of his work through samaritan s purse . no doubt , this relief agency does good work and not everyone who works there agrees with graham . but remember that he gets a hearing because of the scope of that organization . evangelical christians across america enable this platform and graham s mean declarations by supporting samaritan s purse financially and by teaching their children to support it through operation christmas child . do you really want to send a dose of hatred along with that shoebox of christmas trinkets does handing out christmas gifts counterbalance graham s declaration that many of those who receive them would not be welcome in america there are other and better ways to support refugees and children in need around the world . in reality , sending a shoebox of odds and ends is less effective than providing food and clothing and shelter and education . if you are outraged by franklin graham s misrepresentation of christian doctrine , channel your support somewhere else , like world vision or any of the reputable denomination - based relief agencies . let s plant seeds of hope , faith and love that will take root and produce a harvest of righteousness and not just dangerously wrong theology .

a mysterious yellow circular object has been spotted hovering over greater vancouver leaving local meteorologists , scientists and law enforcement baffled . at first i thought , oh great , burnaby is on fire again but then i realized it was moving slowly , said one local vancouver resident who claimed to have witnessed the object rise from fire in the early hours of this morning . from there the Ufo has risen steadily throughout the day , appearing directly over vancouver at approximately 3 pm . one shocked downtown vancouver worker told Ctv news , first thing i noticed was the colour of the sky . all those grey fluffy things had vanished into thin air , and the sky was so blue and bright . it s so weird . how long the the Ufo will remain over the city is unknown but not long enough according to most yellow - disk enthusiasts who have taken to vancouver s previously unused beaches , to worship their supposed god . the vast majority of the gva population seemed quite pleased to finally have a valid reason to wear their ray - bans 24 / 7 . what do you think our new yellow disc overlord join the debate on facebook and twitter

" despite reporting record income , planned parenthood ' s non - abortion services are in steep decline , clients are leaving , and dozens of facilities have closed , " dannenfelser added . " meanwhile , the abortion chain does more than 320 , 000 abortion procedures per year , and they are under federal investigation for their role in the harvest and sale of aborted babies ' body parts for profit . " the revoking of the obama - era policy may not allow states to cut off funding to planned parenthood , as existing federal law is seen by some courts as restricting the states from doing so , but the measure does show the administration ' s support to the states that would like to deny funds to the abortion provider . earlier this month , hhs unveiled a new division , known as the conscience and religious freedom division , meant to defend the conscience rights of medical professionals who hold moral or religious objections to things like abortions or gender reassignment surgery . " no one should be forced to choose between helping sick people and living by one ' s deepest moral or religious convictions , and the new division will help guarantee that victims of unlawful discrimination find justice , " said severino . " for too long , governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection , but change is coming and it begins here and now . "
( photo : reuters / jasen vinlove / usa today sports ) tim tebow speaks with the media after his workout at the mets minor league complex . major league baseball team the new york mets , have once again formally invited christian athlete tim tebow to join their team for spring training in st . lucie , florida . the announcement was made friday and sports fans are wondering whether or not this means he is one step closer to being promoted to the major leagues . tebow is currently a part of new york mets ' class a affiliate team , the fireflies . the former nfl quarterback played for the mets ' minor league system all of 2017 , batting . 226 with eight home runs and 52 rbis in 126 games . he kicked off the season in columbia , south carolina , in the south atlantic league but was promoted to the florida state league to play for class a st . lucie in late june . the 30 - year - old came out the gate swinging when he first joined st . lucie . he batted . 317 over his first 25 games and had a 12 - game hitting streak while playing outfield and as a designated hitter . according to Espn , out of 93 qualified hitters in the south atlantic league at the time , tebow landed at no . 85 as was still promoted to high a ball . now , the mets inviting tebow to big league camp once again guarantees that he will be in the lineup and actually play in the games for spring training . many have criticized the heisman trophy winner ' s ability to play baseball , some even claiming that he only has a position in baseball because he can help sell t - shirts , jerseys and fill the stadium seats . however , tebow continues to defy the odds by being an example for others who wish to live out their dreams . tebow has said that playing major league baseball has always been a childhood dream of his and although numbers like his wouldn ' t normally garner a major - league invite , his age has pushed the mets to accelerate his progress . at the 2017 sabr conference in new york last year , mets general manager sandy alderson told fans that they enjoy having tebow a part of the mets family .

" because of his celebrity status , tebow helped push the fireflies ' average attendance up nearly 40 percent over a year ago . tebow maintained that he ' s not thinking about the naysayers . " it ' s not something that i have to answer , " he said at that press conference . " i just try to go out there and try to work . a lot more smarter , wiser people than me that make those decisions . "
judicial watch sought the copy of the budget prepared or submitted by special counsel robert mueller . but , on friday , january 19 , the justice department notified judicial watch that it refuses to turn over documents , stating : seven pages were located that contain records responsive to your request . we have determined that this material should be withheld in full because it is protected from disclosure under the foia . the justice department asserts the mueller budget information cannot be released because its release could interfere with law enforcement proceedings and the material is protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege . ( washington , dc ) judicial watch today announced that justice department refuses to release the proposed budget of robert mueller s special counsel office . judicial watch is seeking the information through a freedom of information act ( foia ) lawsuit . judicial watch filed a foia lawsuit against the doj on october 5 , 2017 , after it failed to respond to a july 10 , 2017 , request ( judicial watch v . u . s . department of justice ( no . 1 : 17 - cv - 02079 ) ) . judicial watch is seeking : a copy of the budget prepared and submitted by robert s . mueller iii or his staff . a copy of all guidance memoranda and communications by which the justice management division will review the special counsel s office s statement of expenditures a copy of each document scoping , regulating , or governing the special counsel s office appointed under the leadership of mueller iii the justice department has thus far ignored judicial watch s requests for documents about its management of the mueller operation . the justice department also sent judicial watch a copy of a previously published document showing expenditures by the special counsel s office from may 17 , 2017 , to september 30 , 2017 . the total was 3 , 213 , 695 , nearly a million dollars per month . on july 7 , 2017 , the washington post reported that special counsel mueller submitted a proposed budget to the justice department , but officials declined to make the document public and committed only to releasing reports of the team s expenditures every six months . judicial watch is pursuing numerous additional foia lawsuits related to the surveillance , unmasking , and illegal leaking targeting president trump and his associates during the fbi s investigation of potential russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election . special counsel mueller s operation is not above the law . the american people have a right to know how much taxpayer money is planned for his massive investigation , said judicial watch president tom fitton . no one else in dc seems to be providing oversight of the mueller operation , so once again it is up to the citizen s group judicial watch to fight for accountability . more . .
for 25 , 000 we , as a planet , have been leaving on this plane , one that has been rife with evil , negativity , struggles , and challenges . many individuals have been working towards reaching a level of spiritual awakening and enlightenment that will allow them to rise above the negativity and hate that exists in the world around us , however , this is a battle in going against the current , surrounded by the struggles and hurt of the masses . good news we have reached an incredible time , an opportunity for true ascension . this occurs during a phenomenon called an event horizon , a time when the energy and light from the galactic central sun and the energy from the core of the earth , the heart of our planet , meet upon the planet s surface . this causes a big wave or flash both of light and divine energy , spreading out across the planet reaching all living entities . to better understand this , you must realize the difference between the sun as we know it , the provider of light and warmth on our planet , and the galactic central sun . a source of spiritual energy , the galactic central sun is an object located in the sagittarius constellation . from a scientific stance , an event horizon can be defined as a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer . in other words , the event horizon is the point of no return . from a spiritual perspective , the phenomenon is similar , this is a point in our spiritual existence at which you can no longer turn back , a line in the sand marking a significant shift . those coming up to this shift cannot see it or life beyond it , however , and those who have been delivered through the ascension cannot return to their lives before it . as this energy spreads across the planet it will bring with it great joy , love , and peace . reaching into even the darkest of corners and forgotten places on the planet , it will drive out negativity and hate replacing it with its healing light . this is a major shift that has never before been seen here on earth , one that will be felt by each and every one of us whether we believe in its existence or not . it s power , however , will be powered and intensified by the positivity of those of us here on the planet . for this reason , it is important that we understand it s full powers and prepare for it to come . the early stages of spiritual ascension are not always comfortable , often involving symptoms such as headaches , body aches , and pains , bursts of energy and mood swings . this is the time in which your body , mind , and soul are working through the energy shift , adjusting to the new , higher frequencies . try to remain patient with yourself and practice self - care , ensuring that you are getting enough rest to allow your body to work through this somewhat challenging time . in order to help boost the positive reach of this phenomenon , we need to begin by practice regular ascension meditation . this may be as simple as a 30 min meditation daily , focusing on the overall betterment of humanity . this means envisioning true , unconditional love surrounding and embracing our planet , and everyone on it . for others , ascension meditation is slightly more structured , but still with the same end goal of welcoming , encouraging and empowering the positive energies that will bring humanity through the ascension process . the more that we share this message and band together , practicing regular ascension meditation and empowering the coming energies , the more incredible this shift will be for humanity . try this guided ascension meditation :
the human body is a fascinating topic that can command our attention for hours , but there is no organ quite as fascinating and unbelievable as that of the human brain . weighing , on average , a mere 3 pounds , the human brain acts as command central for our entire bodies , determining how we act , react , how we feel , interpreting our senses and telling our muscles how to move and function . containing approximately 100 billion neurons or nerve cells , it can process information as slowly as 0 . 5 m / sec or as fast as 120 m / sec , a feat that many of us take for granted as brett wingeier , ph . d . , an engineer , neuroscientists and the co - founder of halo neuroscience explains , your brain is constantly working to sense , process , think , move , and even dream . by understanding how the neurons connect , which electrical impulses carry messages to various organs in the body and which area of the brain is associated with our various senses we can begin to wrap our head around its incredible function , but what about the topics of intelligence , problem - solving and critical thinking skills experts say that you can actually strengthen your brain s function in a similar way to an athlete strengthening their muscles working out . by reading , doing puzzles and challenging our ability to solve various problems we can keep our brain active and working in its optimal condition . the internet is packed with amazing examples of critical thinking and problem - solving riddles , each pushing us to think outside the box and expand our mental capacity . here are 22 incredible thought experiments to challenge your mind : 1 recently featured in an episode of dr . who , the bootstrap paradox was named after a time travel story written by robert a . heinlein called by his bootstraps . this poses the idea that if an object or piece of information is sent back it in time it will become trapped in an infinite loop , never actually having a noticeable origin . for example , if the doctor in dr . who goes back in time and gives a young beethoven a copy of his famous sonatas , and he publishes them , who actually composed these works 2 roman poet and philosopher titus lucretius carus posed the following question which continues to leave many scratching their heads today : if atoms in our brain always act predictably , how can we have free will 3 popularized by john maynard keynes , a renowned economist , the paradox of thrift introduces an interesting and complex problem that underlies our current economic system . it proposes that during difficult economic times everyone should save their money as it is the responsible thing to do , avoiding spending on things that we do not need . however , if each of us starts saving all of our money and cutting our unnecessary spending then that will cause the aggregate demand to drop , and as the impact of that shift takes investments will give lower return and income will also decline meaning that we will , ultimately , have fewer savings . 4 the following paradox was based on a true story . known as the paradox of the court , it tells the famous conundrum of protagoras and his pupil euathlus . consider this one seriously and try applying it to a more modern setting john taught law to bill with the condition that bill would pay the tuition fee after he had won his first case . long after bill finished his lessons , he did not get any case either on purpose so that he never had to pay for the lessons or simply because no one hired him . john then sued bill in small claims court for the tuition fee . john : if i win the suit , then by verdict bill will have to pay me ; however , if bill wins , he will also have to pay me because our agreement says he will pay me when he s won his first case . as such , it would be wise for the court to simply make bill pay me . bill : if i win the suit , then by verdict i needn t pay john . if john wins the case , then i still won t have to pay him because i haven t won any cases . as such , it would be wise for the court to throw out his suit . you re the judge ; what do you do 5 classical philosopher and poet epidmenides once wrote all cretans are liars . while this may seem like a simple phrase it was the birth of a new paradox , epidmenides paradox . you see , epidmenides himself was a cretan , therefore he is stating that he too is a liar . however , if he is a liar , then his statement that all cretans are liars must also be a lie meaning that all cretans tell the truth . this would then state that epidmenides must tell the truth a circular pattern of thinking leaves one trying to determine the phrase all cretans are liars can be both true and false at the same time . 6 zeno was a greek philosopher in around 500 b . c . e . who proposed a number of interesting thought experiments and paradoxes , calling many areas of common thinking and beliefs into question . one of these areas was that of motion and its existence or lack thereof according to what he proposes as logical thinking . one of his famous paradoxes of motion , the paradox of the arrow states this : for motion to occur , an object must move from one place in space / time to another . using an arrow as a reference , if an observer were able to stop time , you would notice that the arrow was not moving in that instant . the arrow had to be either moving to where it is , or moving to where it isn t , yet in any given instant the arrow is motionless . if in any instant no motion is occurring , then no motion can occur in any moment , and therefore motion cannot happen . 7 introduced by the muslim philosopher avicenna , the floating man problem questions our real existence in relation to our thoughts , memories , and experiences . this poses the question , what truly defines existence it asks : imagine a man is created in total sensory deprivation . he cannot see , hear , taste , smell , or touch . can he know that he exists while avicenna himself assumed the answer would be yes , pointing to the existence of the human soul , this question has continued to circulate among philosophers and not all shared his conclusion . 8 in an effort to point out how different legal consequences can follow a homicide case depending on the twists that the situation may take , don harper mills , the president of the american academy of forensic sciences introduced the fictional murder case of ronald opus . here is the original case in its entirety . if you were responsible for persecuting this case , what would your conclusion be on march 23 , 1994 , a medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a gunshot wound of the head caused by a shotgun . investigation to that point had revealed that the decedent had jumped from the top of a ten - story building with the intent to commit suicide . ( he left a note indicating his despondency . ) as he passed the 9 th floor on the way down , his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window , killing him instantly . neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8 th - floor level to protect some window washers , and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this . ordinarily , a person who starts into motion the events with a suicide intent ultimately commits suicide even though the mechanism might not be what they intended . that he was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide , but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands . further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9 th floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife . he was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight . therefore , when he pulled the trigger , he completely missed his wife , and the pellets went through the window , striking the decedent . when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt , one is guilty of the murder of subject b . the old man was confronted with this conclusion , but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded . it was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun . he had no intent to murder her ; therefore , the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident . that is , the gun had been accidentally loaded . but further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident . that investigation showed that the mother ( the old lady ) had cut off her son s financial support , and her son , knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly , loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother . the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus . now comes the exquisite twist . further investigation revealed that the son , ronald opus himself , had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered . this led him to jump off the ten - story building on march 23 , only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a 9 th story window . the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide . 9 here s one that will really get you thinking . while the exact origin of this picture is unknown , it has circulated a number of social media platforms including facebook , twitter , and google + . this one may have you stumped for a bit how would you answer this riddle 10 in 1982 philosopher frank jackson came up with a thought experiment known as what did mary know this as used to argue the association between consciousness and non - physical knowledge . is it possible that there are some facts in life that escape a real physical explanation imagine a girl called mary . she is a brilliant neuroscientist and a world expert on color vision . but because she grew up entirely in a black and white room , she has never actually seen any colors . many black and white books and tV programmes have taught her all there is to know about color vision . mary knows facts like the structure of our eyes and the exact wavelengths of light that stimulate our retinas when we look at a light blue sky . one day , mary escapes her monochrome room , and she walks through the grey city streets . she sees a red apple for the first time . what changes upon mary s encounter with the red apple has mary learnt anything new about the color red upon seeing the color for the first time 11 the barn - pole paradox is one of a number of similar special relativity problems that use various props to make the same point . approaching a situation from multiple points of view , it poses an interesting question that many find difficult to answer . the problem goes like this : these are the props . you own a barn , 40 m long , with automatic doors at either end , that can be opened and closed simultaneously be a switch . you also have a pole , 80 m long , which of course won t fit in the barn . now someone takes the pole and tries to run ( at nearly the speed of light ) through the barn with the pole horizontal . special relativity ( sr ) says that a moving object is contracted in the direction of motion : this is called the lorentz contraction . so , if the pole is set in motion lengthwise , then it will contract in the reference frame of a stationary observer . you are that observer , sitting on the barn roof . you see the pole coming towards you , and it has contracted to a bit less than 40 m in your reference frame . so , as the pole passes through the barn , there is an instant when it is completely within the barn . at that instant you close both doors simultaneously , with your switch . of course , you open them again pretty quickly , but at least momentarily you had the contracted pole shut up in your barn . the runner emerges from the far door unscathed . but consider the problem form the point of view of the runner . she will regard the pole as stationary , and the barn as approaching at high speed . in this reference frame , the pole is still 80 m long , and the barn is less than 20 m long . surely the runner is in trouble if the doors close while she is inside . the pole is sure to get caught . well , does the pole get caught in the door or doesn t it 12 greek philosopher socrates was once quoted saying , i know one thing ; that i know nothing . while his intention was to highlight that the more we know , the more we don t know , with the acquisition of more knowledge only leading us to more unanswered questions , the whole concept can leave you thinking for hours . based on what you currently know today , what do you not know what will you not know tomorrow 13 the ship of theseus or theseus s paradox is a thought experiment most notably recorded by plutarch in the last first century . the original paradox stated : the ship wherein theseus and the youth of athens returned from crete had thirty oars , and was preserved by the athenians down even to the time of demetrius phalereus , for they took away the old planks as they decayed , putting in new and stronger timber in their places , in so much that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers , for the logical question of things that grow ; one side holding that the ship remained the same , and the other contending that it was not the same . modern takes on this paradox include a sock where the holes are replaced with patches , or grandfather s axe which , over time , has had both the handle and the head replaced . is it still considered the original axe , or is it now a new object 14 irish scientist william molyneux posed this question in 1688 and it still has many of us thinking today if a man who is born blind learns to distinguish between a sphere and a cube by touching them , and one day regains his sight , would he be able to tell which of the objects placed in front of him is a sphere and a cube by only looking at them what do you think 15 olbers paradox was named after german astronomer heinrich wilhelm olbers . also known as the dark night sky paradox it argues that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the stated fact that there is an infinite number of stars in the universe . by this theory of the infinite stars , any line of sight from earth must , ultimately , end at the surface of a star , which would , by definition , be bright . so why is the sky that we observe dark 16 a story first used by american philosopher edmund l . gettier in his discussions about the concept of justified true belief , this is sure to leave you wondering a near - sighted farmer anxiously asked the milkman whether he d seen a cow on his rounds because his cow was missing . the milkman pointed further down the road and told the farmer , don t worry , she s over there in that field . the farmer squinted and saw a black and white shape near some trees in the middle of the field and thanked the milkman in relief . meanwhile , as the milkman passed the field he took another look and notice that the cow was actually hidden by high grass ; what he d pointed out to the farmer were black and white sheets hanging in a tree . even though the cow was in the field , was the milkman correct when he d said he knew it was there 17 while discussing the topic of personal identity , british philosopher derek parfit introduced what has now come to be known as the teletransporter thought experiment . it asked this if you were to use a teleporter in order to travel to mars , and this specific device mapped out every particle within your body , creating an exact replica of yourself on mars while destroying the original here on earth , maintaining your memories along with the memories , and others have no doubt in meeting you that this is you from a first - person perspective having used the teleporter , would you continue to exist or are you actually dead an interesting thought with the growing interest in new forms of space travel in our future 18 consider this question first asked by archytas in 5 th century bc : if i arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven ( universe ) , could i extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not this raises a seriously interesting question what exactly is the universe expanding into is it a void or nothingness if so , wouldn t that void also be part of our universe 19 have you ever stopped to consider the existence of intention and what it truly means this is what as called into question by moral and political philosopher gregory s . kavka in the toxin puzzle , first introduced in 1983 . it states that : an eccentric billionaire places before you a vial of toxin that , if you drink it , will make you painfully ill for a day , but will not threaten your life or have any lasting effects . the billionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if , at midnight tonight , you intend to drink the toxin tomorrow afternoon . he emphasizes that you need not drink the toxin to receive the money ; in fact , the money will already be in your bank account hours before the time for drinking it arrives , if you succeed . all you have to do is . . . intend at midnight tonight to drink the stuff tomorrow afternoon . you are perfectly free to change your mind after receiving the money and not drink the toxin . the question remains ; however , can you actually intend to drink the toxin if you know that you intend to change your mind at a later time or does intending to change your mind negate your claim to intend to drink it 20 the crocodile dilemma , also known as crocodile sophism , is a paradox that dates back to ancient greece . it is believed to be logically impossible , however , it is sure to get you thinking the paradox goes like this : a crocodile has captured a little boy . being the reasonable crocodile that he is , the croc promises the little boy s father that he will release the kid only if the father can predict what the crocodile will do next . the father of the boy says , you will not give my son back . now the croc is in a bind . if the feather was correct in his statement , the croc keeps the kid . but if the croc keeps the kid , the croc is not keeping his promise to return the boy . but once the croc returns the boy , the father s prediction is no longer correct . what should the crocodile do 21 referred to as the trolley problem , this ethical dilemma has stumped people for generations . sometimes told with a trolley , other times told with a train , the question is raised , will you personally take a life to save the lives of many there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks . ahead , on the tracks , there are five people tied up and unable to move . the trolley is headed straight for them . you are standing some distance off in the train yard , next to a lever . if you pull this lever , the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks . however , you notice that there is one person on the side track . you have two options : ( 1 ) do nothing , and the trolley kills the five people on the main track . ( 2 ) pull the lever , diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person . which is the correct choice 22 it feels wrong to end this list of mind - provoking paradoxes without the best - known paradox in existence the chicken and egg paradox . this age - old question sheds light on two very important areas of consideration : the origin of life and the universe , and the case for the circular cause and consequence logical fallacy which can be defined as , when the consequence of the phenomenon is said to be an unavoidable cause of the phenomenon when the truth may be otherwise . so , the question stands what came first , the chicken or the egg featured image via medium

special counsel robert s . mueller is doing anything but slowing down his russia investigation . there is no immediate end in sight as mueller continues to investigate possible trump campaign collusion with russian officials . it could be well into 2018 before mueller and his team complete their investigation . trump s former campaign manager paul manafort and his business partner , rick gates , were the first ones indicted and charged with tax fraud and money laundering . mueller also indicted former white house foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos and former national security adviser michael flynn on charges of lying to the fbi . both pled guilty to the charges . now , corey lewandowski , who was mr . trump s campaign manager until he was fired in june 2016 , is set to testify before congress about russia election meddling . according to the new york post : president trump s former campaign manager corey lewandowski revealed on sunday that he is expected to appear this week before a house panel probing russian involvement in the 2016 election . lewandowski said his appearance before the house intelligence committee either on wednesday or thursday is voluntary and will take place behind closed doors . lewandowski said : i m happy to do it . i didn t collude or cooperate or coordinate with any russian , russian agency , russian government or anybody else , to try and impact this election . i ll be happy to come out and set the record straight about my lack of involvement with any type of foreign entity . also , former white house chief strategist steve bannon is expected to testify before the same house panel this week . trump and bannon have been feuding since author michael wolff released his new tell - all book titled fire and fury : inside the trump white house . at one point , bannon describes trump as acting like a nine - year old . lewandowski said he hasn t actually been contacted by mueller yet , but said he wouldn t hesitate to be interviewed . he said : so , let s come to a resolution . if you need to talk to people who were involved in the campaign to bring that to a resolution , let s do that . but it s time to bring this investigation to a close . trump maintains that mueller wouldn t be likely to interview him since there was no collusion . however , mueller has reached out the president s lawyers and it s very possible . lewandowski said that he would urge trump to tell the truth . he said : there s no question to me , that if he were to sit down and tell that team exactly what took place , and i was there for it , they will come to the same conclusion that everybody else has already come to , which is there is no collusion . lewandowski is also in hot water for accusations by singer joy villa that he assaulted her at a trump hotel party . according to Usa today : rep . adam schiff of california , the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee , told Usa tOday that he believes the house panel still has many months of work ahead of us . he added , however , that he s worried that republicans on the committee may be trying to rush the investigation to a premature close because of pressure from the white house to bring it to an end . let s grab the popcorn and see what happens in the coming months . this is how twitter responded : featured image by taylor hill / getty images
air travel can be a tiring and trying experience . and while it may save you a lot of money , flying coach is hardly ever a pleasant experience unless of course the flight is hardly booked and you end up with an entire row to yourself . but if you re on a full flight , then you have to squeeze into your tiny seat with two people you might not know breathing heavy and sneezing on either side of you . while boarding most planes , coach passengers have to walk past the first class passengers as they sip champagne and get pampered in their leather seats . it s easy to feel jealous of their privilege . and because the airline only provides exceptional service to the first class passengers , those in coach get the short end of the stick . with crusty peanuts and sloppy servings of soda , coach has nothing going for it besides saving you some cash . in the same vein , service men and women may be given special treatment while boarding the plane but if they didn t pay for it , they don t get first class treatment . but on a recent flight , jessica titus , a coach passenger , noticed a man from the first - class section approach a female servicewoman who was walking through his section of the plane . he sneered at her then followed her back to coach with his eyes . before she could get any further , he stood up and physically blocked her way . this tactic , employed by abusive husbands and boyfriends , shocked the service woman . and she immediately put up her defense . however , the aggressive stranger had an alternative motive . and it was nothing as it seemed . instead , he offered to trade his first class seat for her coach one . he wanted the army servicewoman to be treated like royalty because she had served america in his stead and he wanted to show her his appreciation for that . although she hadn t the money to purchase a first class ticket , the rich man thought she deserved to sit in first class more than he did . that s why he stood up and trade seats with her in front of everyone . titus explained the story in a love what matters post on facebook : on my flight tuesday , i walked down the jetway behind a woman in uniform ( army ) . a man stood up from his 1 st class seat and said , sorry ma am , i m in your seat . what does your ticket say he asked . she replied , what no i m 31 b . he walked away , leaving her with his first class seat and then took her middle seat in coach . in response , titus wanted to give the generous man a treat for honoring the servicewoman when no one else would . she wrote a short note and then attached a small bill to it to help get him a drink or snack . but the do - gooder refused to take her money . spoiler alert , he refused my offer . do good . recognize good . make the world better . what do you think about this first class passenger s kindness toward our service men and women

becoming a new parent has the potential be one of the most exciting times in a person s life . these new and exciting times can also bring a lot of stresses and worry . staying positive throughout the ups and downs can be key to handling uncertainty , but preparing for worst - case scenarios can make you much more adept to handle tough situations when they arise . quite unanimously , parents hope and anticipate their children will be born healthy and happy . for one young couple expecting the arrival of their baby boy , they knew brody would be a little different , but wouldn t grasp the extent of his differences until after he was born . the couple found out during their 24 - week ultrasound that brody would be born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate . they were told to expect their son would be afflicted with health problems that accompany this type of deformation , with the doctor even asking the parents if they wanted to consider options other than carrying through with the pregnancy . the young couple wouldn t be deterred from having their son . not caring if he looked a little unusual , they were prepared to accommodate any extra health problems that would arise from their son s condition . with their love for their son already in full force before his birth , the parents had no doubt in their minds that they would keep him . they hoped to change people s perceptions of children born with birth defects and deformities by not giving up on their baby . it is ok to be proud of your baby no matter the circumstances . we wanted to change what ultrasound / newborn / first year pictures on our facebook / instagram accounts looked like . we wanted to spread awareness of cleft lips and palates , said sara , brody s mother . caused when certain tissues don t form or fuse , cleft lips and palate are very common birth defects that can make it hard for the baby to eat , drink , smile , and even breathe . without having the defect surgically corrected , the child may be unable to speak and live a normal life , so most parents opt to have the surgery to correct their baby s cleft corrected . despite brody s cleft , his parents sara and chris were proud and overjoyed with the birth of their son . to an outpouring of support , they shared photos of their son on social media . some people were curious about brody s face , leading some with little tact to ask sara what was wrong with her baby s face . while these questions were upsetting to the new mother , she exercised grace and used the opportunity to educate others about the condition in an attempt to promote awareness and cut down on future ignorance , saying : i decided to educate rather than create a confrontation because that is what i want brody to do in the future . i will want him to educate , to be an advocate for younger cleft kids who don t have their own voice yet . the outpouring of support the family has experienced manifested in the gift of 1000 from a waiter while out for dinner with a friend , with which sara and chris were able to cover some medical expenses for brody s surgery to repair his cleft . brody , a happy young boy , had his surgery last year and has been recovering well , though he may need further surgeries in the future . his mom said : this experience has shown us just how strong the cleft community is . we ve been contacted by people all over the country . they are praying for us and asking us to reach out if we need anything .
( photo : reuters / nigel roddis ) members of the church of england ' s synod vote on one of the motions during the session during which approved the consecration of women bishops , in york , july 14 , 2014 . leaders of the church of england will debate at their governing body next month whether they should have a priest - sharing arrangement with the methodists to " sustain christian presence . " the proposal will be discussed at the general synod in february , as there are " serious challenges in sustaining a christian presence , " according to the telegraph , which spoke to some leaders of the denomination . " whilst such co - operation is already possible and practised in many rural contexts , priests / presbyters exercising ministry in both churches at the same time could build on that in new ways , " the rt revd dr christopher cocksworth , bishop of coventry , said in a statement . cocksworth explained , " these would include helping one another to maintain a reliable pattern of public worship in the communities they serve , fostering imaginative initiatives in mission , and enabling strategic decisions to be made about which communities will be the particular focus for ministers serving overlapping geographical areas . " methodism originated as a revival within the 18 th century church of england and became a separate denomination after the death of john wesley . some senior figures are , however , warning that the arrangement could be " very problematic . " the church of england ' s top civil servant , william nye , said the proposal could be divisive given that methodist clergy who had not been ordained by a bishop would be allowed to hold church of england services . nye added that the plan would break the " continuous apostolic succession " that church of england members believe links their clergy and bishops to the original followers of jesus christ . a survey released earlier this month by the christian humanitarian charity tearfund showed that only 20 percent of u . k . adults pray regularly , or at least once a month , but only 9 percent go to church regularly . the survey also showed that more than half of adults , 51 percent , say they ever pray , but only one in three people pray in a place of worship . according to data released by the church of england last year , an average of 930 , 000 people , 14 percent of whom were children , attended weekly worship services during october 2016 . the smallest 25 percent of churches reported no children attended on average . a survey commissioned by the church of england found last year that only 6 percent of british adults are practicing christians .
freedom rider : oligarch jeff bezos republicans and democrats alike are willing to turn over government coffers to bezos and his ilk and the rights of the people be damned . amazon cEo jeff bezos has a net worth of 105 billion and is the richest man in the world . but he is not just the richest man at this moment in history . he is the richest person who has ever lived . as of 2017 he and seven other billionaires had a collective net worth equal to that of the poorest 3 . 6 billion people on earth . these figures have been in the news of late but without much useful analysis . the corporate media refuse to state what is obvious . namely that inequality is worse around the world precisely because these super rich people demand it . while pundits and politicians go on breathlessly about oligarchs in russia , they seldom take a look at the wealthiest in their own back yard and the control they exert over the lives of millions of people . when amazon announced it would choose a site for its new headquarters cities across the country began a furious race to the bottom . amazon is not alone in the thievery department . major corporations like walmart always request and receive public property and public funds in order to do business . boston offering 75 million to amazon while houston is willing to part with 268 million . some 235 cities have put themselves in the running for this dubious venture . chicago is willing to give amazon 1 . 3 billion in payroll taxes that prospective employees would ordinarily pay that city . if chicago wins this booby prize amazon employees would pay taxes to their employer and not to the government . this is truly cutting out the middle man and makes real the rule of , by , and for the wealthiest . the potential for public outrage isn t lost on unprincipled politicians . some cities now refuse to reveal how much they plan to give away . but the news to date is disheartening with boston offering 75 million while houston is willing to part with 268 million . amazon says it will hire 50 , 000 people but their business model already pays employees so little that many of them qualify for public assistance , despite being employed . the united states is as much of an oligarchy as countries it usually disparages but it is far more dishonest about its true nature . all talk of democracy is a lie as the rich get richer , by an additional 1 trillion in 2017 , and wield more and more power over the lives of everyone else . chicago is willing to give amazon 1 . 3 billion in payroll taxes that prospective employees would ordinarily pay that city . the bezos juggernaut is not restricted to theft of public money . he is also the sole owner of the washington post , one of the most influential newspapers in the country . bezos owns a newspaper that is an organ of the ruling elite and he also has a 600 million contract to provide the central intelligence agency with cloud computing services . the washington post was the force behind propaganda or not , an effort to destroy left wing voices like those at black agenda report . under the guise of fighting russia and so - called fake news the bezos owned post began the censorship campaign that has put the left s presence on the internet in such jeopardy . politicians outdo one another giving away public resources to the richest man on the planet who also owns a major newspaper and services the surveillance state . if it can be said that any one person rules the world bezos would be obvious choice . no one in chicago , boston , houston or any of the other cities giving away the store ever voted for jeff bezos . all talk of democracy is a sham as long as the richest people take from the rest of humanity . the effort to make government an irrelevance is thoroughly bipartisan . republicans and democrats alike are willing to turn over government coffers to bezos and his ilk and the rights of the people be damned . the bezos owned post began the censorship campaign that has put the left s presence on the internet in such jeopardy . whoever wins this tarnished brass ring ought to be consigned to political defeat . the mayor , aldermen , city council members or whoever else brings disaster to their locality should be punished for aiding and abetting the theft . if these cities can give to the richest man who ever lived , they can surely use public money to help their residents right now . but they will never do that because they are all bought off and compromised . they are either cynical or afraid to go against the real rulers of the country . bezos may look like the villain in a james bond movie but there is nothing funny about him . he is deadly serious and so are his intentions . in a bezos run world every worker will be impoverished , every level of government will subsidize corporations , and anyone who speaks out will be discredited and under surveillance . the last thing any city needs is a new amazon headquarters . we need an end to billionaire rule in this country and around the world . that will be the salvation of the people , not more sweat shops run by wealthy people who steal from everyone else . margaret kimberley s freedom rider column appears weekly in bar , and is widely reprinted elsewhere . she maintains a frequently updated blog as well at < URL > . ms . kimberley lives in new york city , and can be reached via e -

after converting to islam , a texas college professor , daneil mashburn ( right ) , tried to bring his students to his newfound faith by babbling incoherently about the tenets of islam instead of doing what he was being paid to do teach astronomy . but what students saw him do next had them fleeing the classroom and frantically calling 911 , thinking they were witnessing the prelude to an islamic terror attack . fox news on january 16 , tarrant county college students attended an astronomy lecture to find that their professor was nowhere in sight . once the students had taken their seats , tcc adjunct professor daniel mashburn entered , turned off the lights , and launched into a psychotic rant in which he proselytized islam to his terrified pupils . students feared they might be witnessing a terror attack unfolding as mashburn , who they didn t even know was their professor , had covered his identity with a baseball cap , knit hat , gloves , hooded coat , and a scarf over his face , according to fox news students say the professor talked about the koran and the moon and the dark night and seemed incoherent and never discussed anything astronomy - related . mostly he was talking about different things of the muslim faith , mcleod said . he kept messing with his pocket and you could tell there was an object in the right - hand pocket . and whenever he went to pull out his hand , i started having this really bad feeling and jumped up and ran out of the classroom . all but 2 of the 25 students attending the lecture scrambled to get out of the classroom , worried that the seemingly disturbed professor might have something ominous planned . others called 911 to report mashburn s terrifying behavior , which prompted him to launch into yet another hysterical islamic rant . daniel mashburn then admits that he purposefully kept his teaching philosophy , which undeniably involves preaching islam in the classroom , a secret from his tcc superiors . he finally confesses that he is tired of hiding in the shadows and fearing their law before sinisterly declaring i fear allah . mashburn then displayed a paperback quran , telling todd that he holds the universe in his right hand . mashburn was suspended indefinitely by the college , and his replacement is expected to arrive for the next class , according to the report . no criminal charges were filed .
black alliance for peace calls on the u . s . to end its war in afghanistan black alliance for peace calls on the u . s . to end its war in afghanistan by bar editor and columnist ajamu baraka u . s . policy - makers see the continued presence of the u . s . in afghanistan as a strategy to counter the growing cooperation between china and the russian federation and the chinese silk road project . with the announcement that the trump administration concluded its analysis of the war in afghanistan , the administration had an opportunity to announce a sensible solution to the longest war in u . s . history by calling on all parties to the conflict to enter into serious discussions to create a process for national reconciliation and peace . instead , the administration committed the u . s . to an endless war in afghanistan with no clear criterion for what the administration would define as a win . moreover , by suggesting that the administration intends to play up to india , pakistan s bitter rival , so india can play a larger role in solving the conflict in afghanistan amounts to a dangerous and cynical ploy that could inflame the already tense relations between the two nuclear - armed nations . trump s call for support for an increase to military spending was a crude and opportunistic rationalization for endless war and the squandering of the nation s precious resources , including the lives of its young . trump s call for support for an increase to military spending was a crude and opportunistic rationalization for endless war . the policies of this administration reflect a continued commitment on the part of the u . s . oligarchy to utilize military force to advance its interests throughout the world . members of the black alliance for peace ( bap ) understand that u . s . policy - makers see the continued presence of the u . s . in afghanistan as a strategy to counter the growing cooperation between china and the russian federation and the chinese silk road project . we also know that u . s . capitalists have their eyes on newly discovered and untapped mineral reserves of iron , cobalt , copper , gold , and lithium estimated at a value of over one trillion dollars . this increases afghanistan s value for the u . s . corporate and financial sector , which has no problem sending young people off to die for its narrow interests . with the bipartisan vote in the u . s . house of representatives to increase the military budget by 75 billion - - a figure that represents more than the entire military budget of the russian federation - - it is no longer accurate to characterize this grotesque proposal as a trump proposal . the commitment to full spectrum dominance has always had bipartisan support , but democrats and their liberal allies have been able to present its militarism as somehow more benevolent than the republicans . since the collapse of the soviet union and the emergence of the u . s . as the world s predominant global power , the commitment to maintain u . s . hegemony and its predatory form of capitalism known as neoliberalism has always been a bipartisan objective . u . s . capitalists have their eyes on newly discovered and untapped mineral reserves estimated at a value of over one trillion dollars . candidate trump questioned the wisdom of u . s . involvement in afghanistan seeing it as a lost cause that wasted resources and lives . now president trump has a different take . joining the last two presidents before him , he adopted the agenda of military - industrial elites who see the necessity for a permanent u . s . presence in the country resulting in the u . s . and its natO partners establishing nine permanent military bases in the country . the u . s . , as part of the u . s . / eu / natO axis of domination , has been responsible for unspeakable acts of violence in every part of the world with most of the victims of u . s . state violence being the non - european peoples of the world . in an obscene testament to u . s . vanity and the psychopathological commitment to global white supremacy , billions have already been wasted , almost three thousand u . s . lives lost and over 100 , 000 dead . it is time to admit defeat in afghanistan and bring the war to an end . justice and common sense demand that the bloodletting stop . ajamu baraka was the 2016 candidate for vice president on the green party ticket . he is an editor and columnist for the black agenda report and contributing columnist for counterpunch magazine . his latest publications include contributions to killing trayvons : an anthology of american violence ( counterpunch books , 2014 ) , imagine : living in a socialist usa ( harpercollins , 2014 ) and claim no easy victories : the legacy of amilcar cabral ( cOdesria , 2013 ) . he can be reached at www . ajamubaraka . com
view gallery the chinese academy of chinese acadamy of sciences has just cloned the first ever primates using the same method that brought us , dolly , the sheep . if you are unfamiliar with dolly , she was the first ever mammal cloned and is by far the most famous clone . animal cloning from an adult cell is much more difficult than from an embryonic cell . so when scientists working at the roslin institute in scotland produced dolly , the only lamb born from 277 attempts , it was a major news story around the world . to produce dolly , scientists used an udder cell from a six - year - old finn dorset white sheep . they had to find a way to reprogram the udder cells to keep them alive but stop them growing which they achieved by altering the growth medium ( the soup in which the cells were kept alive ) . then they injected the cell into an unfertilized egg cell which had had its nucleus removed , and made the cells fuse by using electrical pulses . the unfertilized egg cell came from a scottish blackface ewe . when the research team had managed to fuse the nucleus from the adult white sheep cell with the egg cell from the black - faced sheep , they needed to make sure that the resulting cell would develop into an embryo . they cultured it for six or seven days to see if it divided and developed normally , before implanting it into a surrogate mother , another scottish blackface ewe . dolly had a white face . from 277 cell fusions , 29 early embryos developed and were implanted into 13 surrogate mothers . but only one pregnancy went to full term , and the 6 . 6 kg finn dorset lamb 6 LLs ( alias dolly ) was born after 148 days . animalresearch . info the difference with these monkeys compared to dolly is that the fact they are primates which brings scientists one step closer to being able to clone humans these baby monkeys look adorable and for right now are both considered to be in good health . the two identical long - tailed macaques named zhong zhong and hua hua were born eight and six weeks ago at a laboratory in china . i know you probably thought having a clone would be awesome , i know i have . think about it for those days you don t feel like getting out of bed and going to school / work you can just send your clone or when you have to go to dinner with your girlfriends family during the big game you can just send your clone . at the same time , it s actually kind of terrifying because for all we know people can make clones of you without your knowledge and then you just have this other you walking around . there is still a ways to go till they have the ability to clone humans safely not to mention all the ethical hurdles they would have to overcome . this is definitely something to stay woke too .
on friday , trump hypocritically signed an mlk day proclamation , after he lambasted haiti , el salvador , and other african nations by referring to them as shithole countries . on monday , martin luther king jr . day , people are remembering trump s words and some are speaking out in accordance . on monday , senator lindsey graham ( r - sc ) leveled heavy criticism on trump for his recent remarks . graham referred to the bipartisan immigration plan , saying : it is going to take you , mr . president , working with republicans and democrats to get this done . it s not going to be done on twitter , by tweeting . it s got to be done by talking and understanding . graham took more shots at trump , and went on to say : the discourse right now is pretty low . those of us in my business need to up their game . it s pretty embarrassing when you have to take your children out of the room to report the news . graham also praised mlk for his legacy and message of focusing on hearts of people when working for positive change in america . he continued with some important words : i told the folks here today the best way to honor martin luther king in 2018 for me is to make sure that we don t go backward . we may not go forward as fast as we would like . we may have differences about what forward looks like . but we sure as hell know what backward looks like . and we re not going backward . senator graham also ended by urging mr . trump to fix daca as soon as possible . he said : mr . president , close the deal 80 percent of americans want to give the daca kids a better life , 80 percent of americans want to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system . trump , while senate minority whip dick durbin ( d - il ) explaining the immigration plan to him during the oval office meeting , said : why do we need more haitians take them out . the day after the meeting on daca , trump tweeted : the so - called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards . wall was not properly funded , chain lottery were made worse Usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly . i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level . i want safety and security for our people . i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs . i want to fund our military , not do a dem defund . . because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety , daca has now taken a big step backwards . the dems will threaten shutdown , but what they are really doing is shutting down our military , at a time we need it most . get smart , make america great agaiN according to cNN the january 19 deadline for reaching agreement on government spending is rapidly approaching which many democrats insist must include immigration and the deferred action for childhood arrivals program is set to end in early march . twitter responded back to senator graham : featured image by lou rocco / abc via getty images
it s only fitting that those who have lost their lives during military service are honored in the most respectable way possible . that is why the patriot guard riders ( pgr ) do what they do . the organization consists of a group of members who attend the funerals of u . s . military members , police , and firefighters at the request of the deceased person s family . their roles include honor guard operations at military burials , protection of mourners , and filling out of the ranks at indigent and homeless veteran burials . in addition to these responsibilities , the national organization also does volunteer work for veteran s organizations and hosts homecoming celebrations . the pgr was front and center when staff sgt . jonathan turner lost his life due to combat - related injuries a year after he retired . tuner served seven tours in iraq and afghanistan and was residing in california when he died . because his family was located in georgia they were unable to attend his funeral in california . this is when the pgr stepped in and made sure that turner s remains would get back to his family properly , instead of being shipped back via fedex . the california patriot guard riders contacted all of the state captains from california to georiga and explained the situation , that it wasn t proper to ship this war hero home via fedex , jeff goodiel of the georgia patriot guard riders said . within days , a convoy was assembled with each state s patriot guard riders driving turner s cremated remains across their state and then passing those remains off to the next group of riders . this particular trip marked a historical moment for the pgr as it was the longest trip of its kind . but this didn t stop volunteers from joining in on the 2 , 000 - mile ride to deliver the remains in a respectable manner . it s heartwarming , to see all these people here , said annie glanton , turner s mother , i know that he was loved by a lot of people . turner was a great leader who inspired his fellow marines , both in the corps and in daily life , a statement on the pgr website states , asserting that turner was well worth the trip . you were his friend if you knew him for five minutes or five years . he would give you the shirt off his back . the video below shows the process that the pgr undergoes in order to safely and respectfully transfer the remains . taking good care of turner s medals , documents , the flag , and remains , the riders ensure that each item is safely encased before it is passed along from one rider to the next . in addition to these items and the remains , every rider who was involved in the process signs a bible that is transferred and given to turner s family . the entire time this process is going on two of the riders are holding up the united states marine corps flag , showing the ultimate respect for ssgt . turner . commenters had positive things to say about the inspiring group
we all want to live a vibrant life full of excitement , adventure and learning . while some of us will get to see more of the world than others , it does not mean we all cannot get the most out of life . for most of us , the key things in life are spending time with loved one s and getting to pick and choose the types of careers we have . janet white was able to live a life that most of us would be proud of . the new york city native spared no time in going after the things she loved to do . her passion was evident in all her vocations , whether it was gardening , running a dairy farm , or traveling with her husband . it was not until later in life that she was able to get away and see part of the world . in her 60 s she took off with her husband to hong kong and then the soviet union . even though all these accomplishments are impressive to say the last , they do not paint the complete picture of who janet smith was , or how she was viewed in the community . the skill with which most people will remember her was quilt making . she created many wonderful quilts with immaculate designs over her long life . with over 100 quilts to her name , most of them given as gifts to her family or friends in the community , janet was able to put her creative juices to work and leave a lasting impression on people . she even made four quilts for her unmarried grandchildren because she wanted to offer them something for the special day women like janet do not come around much , and their important contribution to life must be remembered . how lasting an impression as meaningful as it gets . janet passed away at the age of 84 , and at her funeral , her community came out in support of her wonderful life . her family draped her quilts on the church pews as a symbolic reminder of her generosity and talent . it was a touching moment for everyone at the funeral who knew janet and understood just how deep and giving her spirit was . people who read about his and were not even there had emotional reactions to this gesture . one online reader commented : i m getting a little choked up reading this . the description of the life your grandmother lived seems magnificent and extravagant and it really makes me want to branch out and really truly live life . or take this reflection from another reader : the fact that a mere description of what she did can evoke such an emotional response from a total stranger is absolutely unique . my condolences for your grandmother . we find hero s and leaders in everyday people as long as we look close enough . there are people like janet in your community fighting the good fight and living life like it is a gift all you have to do is find them and you will be inspired to live the same way
when you read , you give yourself the opportunity to immerse yourself in a different world , launching yourself into an adventure you wouldn t otherwise be able to take . reading is a gift , which is why books are such an important part of life . one of the best things about books is that they are timeless . it doesn t matter when they were written , they always offer a chance to the reader to dive into a different world , serving as a perfect chance to escape from a life that is otherwise mundane . thanks to writers who have spilled their creativity out on the pages , we are allowed to enjoy a different time period and a different adventure just by opening up a book . unfortunately , sometimes when people are done with a book , they toss it in the trash and say goodbye to it forever . instead of giving someone else the opportunity to share in the potential adventure , books often end up in landfills with the rest of the trash . this was a common theme until some trash collectors in ankara decided to put other people s trash to good use . not only did the trash collectors collect the discarded books , but they went on to open up their own library stocked with the books that they considered to be treasures . after months of the sanitation workers collecting the books , neighbors caught on to their new hobby and started donating books to them , expanding their collection . it started out with the books being solely for the sanitation employees and their families to enjoy , but word spread fast and due to the considerable amount of interest in the books , a public library was opened last september . we started to discuss the idea of creating a library from these books . and when everyone supported it , this project happened , said ankaya mayor alper tasdelen , whose local government oversaw the opening of the library . ranging from literature to nonfiction , the library has over 6 , 000 books today and it even has a popular kid s section with comic books . there is a section of the library that was designed for scientific research and gives students and professionals a chance to explore their specialties . bilingual visitors are encouraged to visit the library and there are books in both english and french . the building that houses the library was a previously abandoned brick factory located at the sanitation headquarters . with an old exterior and long corridors that are perfect for holding rows and shelves of books , the building is perfect for the library . like most libraries , the books are loaned out for a two - week period and can be extended if needed . the books are truly a gift to the community . on one hand , there were those who were leaving these books on the streets . on the other hand , others were looking for these books , tasdelen said . because the collection grew so big , books are loaned out to schools , educational programs , and even prisons , benefiting everyone involved . village schoolteachers from all over turkey are requesting books , tasdelen said . the city government also hired a full - time employee to manage the library . the library is particularly popular for cyclists who stop by on their route for a cup of tea . before , i wished that i had a library in my house . now we have a library here , serhat baytemur , a 32 - year - old garbage collector , told state media .
starbucks can be a great place to get luxurious coffee products . but it is also a place where freelancers go to work on their projects . whether they are writers or designers or business people , starbucks can offer a safe place for people to drink their beverage of choice while getting work done . yes , it is expensive at the coffee shop , but each starbucks promises the same atmosphere . and that s what they seem to be charging for . although you might assume starbucks employees are stuck in a dead - end job , the corporation tries to empower their workers . they offer a college program that encourages baristas to continue their education , and starbucks will even put toward that goal . and workers develop a strong sense of community among themselves and the customers whom they see every day . shantaphae blakes , who works as a barista part - time at a starbucks , works predominately as a full - time mom . it is hard work balancing all the responsibilities and getting someone to watch after her daughter , dilynn . but on a cold morning last month , shantaphae called he supervisor in tears . she was ready to go to work , but at 4 : 30 am that morning , no one was available to watch her daughter . 21 - year - old harper spell , the shift supervisor at the winston - salem , north carolina starbucks spoke to tOday about what happened next . she was so upset , spell told tOday . ( blakes ) said , i have dilynn in the back seat . would it be ok if i came i just said , don t worry about it . i need you here . we ll take care of dilynn , when the 26 - year - old mother arrived at starbucks , she took her baby to a table . and the shift supervisor and the restaurant manager offered to be dilynn s second mom for the day . the manager needed shantaphae on the job , but understood the reality of being a mother . she offered to help the young mother out generously . she was just wide - eyed , watching us , said spell . we gave her a few little things to play with , something to eat , and she was good . although the supervisor s offer was unconventional , it was honest and filled with joy and love . although dilynn was doing well so early in the morning , the supervisor worried that the little girl would get fussy during the morning rush . as if on cue , regular customers from the north carolina state troopers walked in the door . trooper brad marshall wanted his morning coffee , but he also wanted to help . and because he knew that the morning rush was coming , and he did not have any pressing incidents to report to , he offered to serve his community . trooper brad came in , and he offered to sit with dilynn while we worked , spell said . he stayed for over an hour . never in a million years did i think that ( a trooper ) would just do that , just stay and hang around and help . when shantaphae saw how well the trooper was taking care of her daughter , she was overcome with gratitude . it just blew me away . it was wonderful , the mom said . it shocked me . it made me feel so much better . it takes a village to raise a child .
mr . trump has gone to his mar - a - lago beach club in palm beach , florida , at least ten times since his inauguration , and has visited his properties for more than 33 percent of the time he has been in office . he has also spent more than 25 percent of his days at golf courses . he visits one of his properties nearly every weekend , but bragged that when he became president he wouldn t have time to play golf . according to nbc news : but more than four months into his term , trump has visited golf courses at a faster clip than his three most recent predecessors , according to the new york times . politifact reports that as of november 2017 , trump is confirmed to have golfed 35 times , while at the same point in his presidency , obama had golfed just 11 times . during the campaign , trump argued that americans should vote for him because he would rarely leave washington . he promised that he wouldn t go golfing or take vacations because there was too much work to do . now , after a year ago when spoiled food was found at the mar - a - lago resort , trump s winter white house was just cited by inspectors for poor maintenance . according to the miami herald : trump s club , located on a beachfront property where the historic main house was built in the 1920 s for cereals heiress marjorie merriweather post , was cited nov . 8 for two violations deemed high priority : the lack of smoke detectors capable of alerting the hearing impaired through flashing bright lights ; and slabs of concrete missing from a staircase , exposing steel rebar that could cause someone to fall . the inspection code reads : high priority lodging violations are those which could pose a direct or significant threat to the public health , safety , or welfare , the inspection code reads . the club was re - checked nov . 17 , a week before trump s return for his thanksgiving vacation , and this time met inspection standards . it cost 200 , 000 in initiation fees to trump s mar - a - lago club , which has two restaurants and a bed - and - breakfast . according to state records , mar - a - lago was in need of repairs in order to pass the inspection in november . the miami herald also reported : among the no - nos was the staff s failure to track the freshness of potentially hazardous foods , including curry sauce dated oct . 21 pulled from a freezer and improperly marked , milk stored at 49 degrees instead of the safe temperature of 41 degrees , and cases of hot dogs stored on the ground of the walk - in freezer . apparently , too , the japanese prime minister shinzo abe may have been served sushi back in february 2017 that had not been treated for parasites prior to eating . health inspectors found out the sushi was not treated just days before his visit . the club was also cited for storing food in two broken down coolers at temperatures that caused fresh ingredients to spoil . the inspections in november yielded 15 violations that needed to be corrected . however , the kitchens did pass the inspections on the first try . here is a report that gives a detail of violations from nine months ago : so , it appears that mar - a - lago is the real sh * thole . on saturday night , robin bell , founder of bell visuals , projected the word shithole along with poop emojis onto trump s d . c . hotel . maybe he needs to bring it to palm beach . featured image by davidoff studios / getty images

washington , dc the news of donald trump s approval rating reaching 45 in one opinion poll has been labelled historic by white house officials , who today confirmed the president s approval rating has risen above his iq for the first time . white house press secretary , sarah huckabee sanders , refused to confirm trump s actual iq but acknowledged he was the first president in u . s . history to reach the historic milestone , capping off a year of many firsts for america s highest office . no president has ever done it before and all within his first 12 months . he just keeps surprising us all . it s remarkable , sanders said . president trump is incredibly proud of himself and well he should be . with this being the only opinion poll to show trump s approval rating at 45 , there are also varying reports on the president s iq , with estimates ranging from as high as 44 to as low as minus 8 . regardless , an understandably joyous trump revelled in the news that he finally had the popularity to match his undoubted intelligence . of course we all know i always had the brains , and obViouslY the looks , but now i have the popularity too . totalpackage the president tweeted his 44 million followers . i m getting numbers that no president has ever got , he continued . barack could only dream of getting numbers like mine . obama was so unpopular , trump added , of the man with 92 million twitter followers . his approval rating nEVEr went over his iq once in 8 years . he never even came close . pathetic former president obama did not reply to the tweet directly but did like it . with such positive numbers across the board , trump will now focus solely on his golfing handicap having had such little time to spend on the course so far as president . how proud of president trump are you let us know on facebook and twitter , or support us on patreon for more

subscribe to canada free press for free way too generous to childhood arrivals , and no serious commitment to border security trump responds to flake / graham / durbin immigration proposal : i do not think so i m not sure what more anyone would have expected from these three . graham has never been serious about immigration enforcement . flake has come to identify as nothing more than a trump antagonist . durbin is . . . dick durbin . i have more sympathy for the plight of childhood arrival than your typical conservative , and i think there should be a legislative fix that makes it possible for them to stay here legally ( as opposed to the daca approach that simply ignores statutory law ) , but when this is your starting offer , you re not going to get far . and they didn t : the graham - durbin plan would legalize the dreamers , with a 10 - to - 12 - year path to citizenship , and provide about 2 . 7 billion in funding for border security and operations . it would end the diversity visa lottery , which randomly awards 50 , 000 green cards to would - be immigrants from underrepresented countries , and impose a modest limit on green - card holders to sponsor adult children for immigration to the u . s . ms . sanders s remarks were in keeping with past statements from the white house on the issue , but took on increased significance tuesday as lawmakers take up the immigration issue again in the wake of the brief government shutdown . ms . sanders had said monday that mr . trump would follow through on a promise to work on immigration policy after republicans and democrats reached a deal to reopen federal agencies . that same day , mr . trump hosted a group of six republican senators who have taken a skeptical view of a broad immigration overhaul that would include a long - term deal on the young immigrants sometimes known as dreamers . elements of the graham - durbin plan are likely to be part of the coming senate debate on immigration , which majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r . , ky . ) promised in return for democratic support for ending the government shutdown on monday . in the house , it would be a challenge to pass a bill without mr . trump s backing . house speaker paul ryan ( r . , wis . ) is under pressure from conservative house republicans to consider a separate bill from rep . bob goodlatte ( r . , va . ) . that bill , which ms . sanders said tuesday was something we would support , would provide 30 billion to build a wall along the mexico border and tighten border security , crack down on so - called sanctuary cities that don t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement , and require employers to use e - verify , which allows them to check prospective workers immigration status . it also would provide dreamers three years of renewable legal status but not green cards or a path to citizenship . can we first deal with this whole business of referring to childhood arrivals as dreamers that is an obama term through and through , a classic case of rebranding something to make it seem more sympathetic . the obama administration decided to pin this group with that label and the media enthusiastically co - opted it . it gives the impression we re talking about an earnest group of america - loving , civic - minded go - getters who are ready to change the world for the better if only the mean old iNs would bestow upon them the status of real americans . it s one thing for a partisan group of people to coin a term for propaganda purposes . it s another thing for the supposedly unbiased news media to adopt it as standard language , even capitalizing it and not bothering to apply scare quotes . at least this story dropped a sometimes known as with one reference , but it otherwise used the term as uncritically as you or i would use someone s first name . the accurate term for the people in question is childhood arrivals , and if you really want to be technical , illegal childhood arrivals . that said , i believe the right thing to do is to provide them with a legal way to live here via a change in the law . if your parents brought you here illegally when you were 10 years old , and you spent the rest of your childhood here , you have zero culpability in that . the responsibility lies 80 percent with your parents for breaking the law and 20 percent with a federal government that talks about immigration enforcement but almost never takes it seriously in practice .
build star wars now january 25 , 2018 what would ronald reagan say if he were alive today and saw hawaii living in fear , panicked by the false alarm of a nuclear missile strike from north korea surely , president reagan would ask : " why did you abandon my strategic defense initiative prospective space - based defenses won the cold war , and if deployed would have rendered nuclear missiles obsolete . sdi defeated the evil empire - will america be destroyed by nuclear pygmy north korea " beijing and moscow are quietly laughing . north korean nuclear missiles are built on russian and chinese technology - their north korean nuclear gun aimed at our head . significantly , north korea never makes nuclear threats against china or russia . ronald reagan was right that sdi - derided by the press as " star wars " - leveraged u . s . technological superiority to checkmate the ussr ' s nuclear threat , winning the cold war . liberal press and academics still belittle " star wars . " however , history and testimony of allies and adversaries alike supports ronald reagan ' s sdi . " there was one vital factor in the ending of the cold war . it was ronald reagan ' s decision to go ahead with the strategic defense initiative , " prime minister margaret thatcher once said . " our leadership was convinced that the great technical potential of the u . s . had scored again , " said soviet ambassador to the u . s . anatoly dobrynin . " behind all this [ sdi program ] lies the clear calculation that the ussr will exhaust its material resources , and therefore will finally be forced to surrender , " added ussr foreign minister andrei gromyko . another foreign minister , alexander bessmertnykh , agreed : " [ reagan ' s sdi speech ] made us realize we were in a very dangerous place . [ sdi ] accelerated the decline of the soviet union . " senior russian foreign policy analyst genrikh trofimenko said , in retrospect , " ninety - nine percent of russian people believe that you won the cold war because of your president ' s insistence on sdi . " sdi technology was proven and ready to deploy . but president clinton opposed " star wars " ideologically . protecting america risked mutual assured destruction ( mad ) and " strategic stability . " so clinton ' s secretary of defense , les aspin , boasted he " took the stars out of star wars " canceling sdi . what remains is the technologically truncated national missile defense that cannot defend allies and has hawaii hiding in bomb - shelters . we can win the new cold war by resurrecting sdi and deploying space - based missile defenses . we are still technologically superior to all potential adversaries and can leverage that superiority to protect america from growing nuclear missile threats . russia , china , and north korea are investing billions in nuclear missiles aimed at the united states . it would serve them right - and be the best guarantor of world peace - to checkmate their investment in offensive nuclear missiles with space - based defenses . space - based defenses offer revolutionary advantages over existing national missile defenses ( nmd ) , that cannot protect u . s . allies or bases overseas , might be hard - pressed to defend the u . s . mainland against increasingly sophisticated north korean threats , and cannot defend the u . s . from large - scale nuclear missile threats from russia or china . space - based defenses potentially can do all the above . sdi - type defenses can intercept missiles during all phases of flight : boost - phase , mid - course , and terminal - phase . such a system could shield u . s . allies and troops overseas ; much better protect hawaii , alaska , and distant u . s . territories ; and could not as easily be attacked , overwhelmed , or fooled with decoys as nmd . these advantageous characteristics of space - based defenses are all the more important because of the existential threat from nuclear electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) attack . even a single warhead successfully delivered against allies overseas or against the united states could black out an entire nation and kill millions . even a single weapon detonated for emp at mid - course , over the ocean , would have catastrophic consequences for the world economy . ambassador henry cooper warns : " whether deliberate or accidental , the emp from such high - altitude explosions could disable the world ' s entire undersea cable network that reportedly carries about 10 trillion of financial transactions in a single day as well as huge volumes of data , from e - mails to classified government - to - government information . " " star wars " would certainly not be seen as laughable by russia , china , and north korea , but as so technologically intimidating they would be far less likely to attack , and might even give up on nuclear blackmail . thus , we could win the new cold war with " star wars . " henceforth " star wars " should be an honorific . last but not least " star wars " would render mad obsolete , as ronald reagan intended , and really " provide for the common defense " of the american people , instead of merely avenging them . congress has given a gift to the american people in the fY 2018 national defense authorization act ( hr 2810 ) . it includes section 1685 , " boost phase ballistic missile defense , " and section 1688 , " plan for development of space - based ballistic missile intercept layer . " if president trump ' s ballistic missile defense review runs with these provisions , president reagan ' s vision will be realized of replacing the insanity of mad with the humanity of " star wars " as will his legacy of " peace through strength . " a version of this piece also appeared on the hill .
all the dank memes are gone , moved overseas . what s left is the pepes . worthless , rare pepes . after pepes appeared on the popular reddit - backed website imgflip and were subsequently mass - produced by college students rare pepes took a catastrophic plunge in lulz value . rare pepes were at one time so rare , people thought they d never lose value . in fact , prices even sustained over time as imgflip got stale . but somehow , the influx of pepes continued . through the popular underground imageboard 8 ch . net , pepes continuously emanated without explanation from the / b / subforum . like every meme consumed by 8 chan , rare pepes were first validated through the shitposting website reddit before adoption by 8 chan . as a result , rare pepes are now worthless and the internet once again shifts its focus to outmoded but ironic tweetie and sylvester jokes most commonly spread via facebook : a forced irony that will soon become canon .
